## Conditions Quick Reference

| Scenario | Best Areas | Avoid | Why | Alt Activity |
|----------|-----------|-------|-----|-------------|
| Cold & dry (dew point <35°F, temp 35–55°F, no recent rain) | [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md), [HP40](../areas/hp40.md), [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) | — | Peak friction on all sandstone; send temps. Best day of the trip. | — |
| Humid morning (RH >80%, dew point 35–50°F) | [Stone Fort Main Area](../areas/stone-fort.md) (east-facing, dries first), [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (ridgetop wind) | [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) slopers, shaded boulders anywhere | Morning condensation kills slopers; east/sun-facing rock clears first. Wait until 10 AM+ for other aspects. | Coffee in town, late start |
| Post-rain day 1 (rain within 24 hrs) | [Dayton Pocket](../areas/dayton-pocket.md) (roof problems stay dry), Stone Fort overhangs only | All open-face slabs and vertical walls | Sandstone absorbs water — needs 24–48 hrs to dry. Roof/overhang problems may be climbable. | [Mountain biking](../trails/README.md) (trails drain faster), [rest-day activities](../rest-days/README.md) |
| Post-rain day 2+ (24–48 hrs since rain, clearing skies) | [Stone Fort Main Area](../areas/stone-fort.md) (sunny sectors), [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (ridgetop dries faster) | Stone Fort deep woods, any visibly dark/damp rock | Sunny and wind-exposed sectors dry first. Deep woods and north-facing boulders may still seep. | [Hiking](../trails/README.md) in morning, climb afternoon |
| Warm & humid (temp >60°F, dew point >50°F) | [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (coarser texture helps), [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) crimps/edges | [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) (slopers impossible above 65% RH), all slopers everywhere | Smooth rock loses friction first; coarser textures and incut holds retain usability longer. | [Rest day](../rest-days/README.md), indoor gym ([High Point](../rest-days/README.md)) |
| Windy & cold (sustained 15+ mph, temp <35°F) | [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) (sheltered by forest/boulders), [Dayton Pocket](../areas/dayton-pocket.md) (sheltered gorge) | [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (exposed ridgetop), [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) (mountaintop) | Ridgetop areas get brutal wind chill. Valley-floor and gorge settings provide shelter. | Shorter session with hand warmers |

## Southeastern Sandstone Primer

### How Sandstone Friction Works

Sandstone is composed of compressed sand grains — primarily quartz — bound together by natural cement (silica, calcite, or iron oxide). This structure creates millions of microscopic edges on the rock surface, each one a tiny point of mechanical friction against skin and rubber. Unlike granite, where friction comes from large crystal faces, or limestone, where it comes from chemical features and pockets, sandstone grip is fundamentally *granular*. Every grain is a miniature anchor.

| Property | Sandstone | Granite | Limestone |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Surface texture | Granular; micro-edges from sand grains | Crystalline; flat crystal faces | Smooth to pocketed; chemical features |
| Friction coefficient | ~0.74 (highest) | ~0.65 [UNVERIFIED] | ~0.64 |
| Chalk effectiveness | Very high (+21% with chalk) | High | Moderate |
| Humidity sensitivity | Very high (porous; absorbs moisture) | Moderate (non-porous; surface only) | Moderate--low |
| Skin abrasion | High (sandpaper effect) | Moderate--high (sharp crystals) | Low--moderate |
| Wet climbing safety | Dangerous — weakens rock; damages holds | Generally safe | Generally safe |

This granular texture is why sandstone feels like climbing on fine sandpaper, why chalk works so well on it, and why conditions matter more here than on any other rock type. Water fills the gaps between grains, eliminating the micro-edges that provide grip, and can weaken the cement binding grains together — permanently damaging holds.

### Dew Point vs. Humidity Explanation

Relative humidity is misleading for climbers because it is *relative* to air temperature. Cold air holds far less moisture than warm air, so 80% humidity at 35°F contains a fraction of the water vapor that 50% humidity at 75°F does. This is why a crisp February morning can read 80%+ on a humidity gauge yet deliver outstanding friction, while a mild spring afternoon at 55% humidity feels greasy.

**Dew point** is the metric that matters. It measures the absolute moisture content of the air — the temperature at which water vapor condenses into liquid. A low dew point means there is genuinely little moisture in the air, regardless of what the relative humidity number says. When the rock surface temperature is above the dew point, moisture evaporates off the rock. When the rock is at or below the dew point, condensation forms on holds.

| Dew Point | Friction Rating | Recommendation |
|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| Below 35°F | Excellent | Send temps — go climb |
| 35--50°F | Good | Most problems will feel fine |
| 50--60°F | Degraded | Slopers noticeably affected; crimps still okay |
| Above 60°F | Poor | Avoid sandstone; consider indoor gym |

February in Chattanooga averages 31--33°F dew points — firmly in the "excellent" zone. This is the single most important reason February is prime bouldering season.

### Optimal Temperature Ranges

Temperature affects friction through three mechanisms: skin moisture (warm hands sweat), shoe rubber stiffness (cold rubber is stiffer and more precise), and rock surface condensation (cold rock can dip below dew point).

| Range | Rating | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Below 30°F | Too cold | Numb fingers, stiff shoe rubber. Bring hand warmers |
| 32--50°F | Peak friction ("send temps") | Best skin-to-rock adhesion |
| 50--60°F | Good | Most climbers comfortable |
| Above 60°F | Declining | Sweaty hands; not typical for Feb Chattanooga |

For the trip window (Feb 14--21), mornings in the 30s and afternoons in the low 50s put the bulk of each climbing day squarely in the peak friction range. The practical challenge is the low end: below ~35°F, fingers lose dexterity. Hand warmers and a warm-up boulder help bridge the gap until temps climb into the ideal window.

### Why "Cold and Dry" Is the Mantra

Every experienced Southeast boulderer will tell you the same thing: *cold and dry*. Here is why each half matters:

- **Cold** keeps your skin from sweating, keeps shoe rubber stiff and precise, and keeps rock surface temperature above the dew point (so moisture evaporates off holds rather than condensing onto them).
- **Dry** means a low dew point — less water vapor in the air, less condensation on rock, more effective chalk, and better adhesion between skin and stone.

Together, cold and dry conditions produce maximum friction on sandstone's granular surface. This is why October through March is peak Southeast bouldering season, and why climbers from across the country time their Chattanooga trips for winter. February sits at the heart of that window.

### What "Greasy Rock" Means

When climbers say the rock "feels greasy," they are describing a measurable loss of friction. Four mechanisms cause it:

1. **Surface moisture** — A thin film of water from humidity, dew, or incomplete drying after rain fills the micro-gaps between sand grains, eliminating the mechanical friction that makes sandstone grippy. Even invisible moisture degrades friction.
2. **Clay content** — Some sandstone layers contain clay minerals that swell when wet, creating a slick, soap-like film on the rock surface. This is especially common at Stone Fort on certain blocs.
3. **Skin moisture** — On humid or warm days, a climber's own sweat contributes to the problem. Sweaty fingertips on damp rock is a compounding effect that chalk alone cannot fully counter.
4. **Temperature above optimal** — Warm rubber becomes softer and less precise, and warm rock radiates heat that accelerates finger sweating. The friction coefficient drops as temperature rises.

**Field diagnosis tip:** Press your palm flat on the rock surface for 2 seconds. If your hand slides at all, or you see a faint damp outline when you lift it, conditions are suboptimal. Try a different aspect (sun-facing rock may have dried), move to a higher-elevation area with more wind exposure, or wait for conditions to improve.

### Practical Pre-Departure Checklist

Before driving to any area, check these five metrics. A quick look at [NWS Chattanooga](https://www.weather.gov/mrx/) and [weather.gov hourly forecasts](https://forecast.weather.gov/) covers all of them.

| Metric | Good | Marginal | Avoid |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Dew point | Below 35°F | 35--50°F | Above 50°F |
| Temperature (air) | 35--55°F | 25--35°F or 55--65°F | Below 25°F or above 65°F |
| Recent rain | None in 48+ hours | None in 24--48 hours | Rain within 24 hours |
| Wind | Light--moderate (5--15 mph) | Calm or 15--25 mph | Sustained 25+ mph |
| Cloud cover | Clear or partly cloudy | Overcast (delays drying) | Active precipitation |

**If conditions are marginal on rain:** Check for sheltered or overhanging problems that stay dry, or choose areas with faster drying characteristics. Ridge-top areas like Rocktown dry faster than forested valley-floor areas like the deep woods sections of Stone Fort, because wind exposure and sun angle promote evaporation. Overhanging faces and roof problems can often be climbed within hours of rain, while low-angle slabs may need the full 48 hours.

## Area Conditions Synthesis

### [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md)

Bullet-hard Cumberland Plateau sandstone with fast-drying sunny sectors and slow-drying deep woods -- the most versatile Tier 1 area, climbable in the widest range of conditions.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Fine-grained "bullet" sandstone (grey and orange). Extremely durable, dense, high friction. |
| Humidity sensitivity | Moderate. Slopers degrade above ~55--60% RH; crimps and edges remain usable at higher humidity. Slab problems are the most humidity-sensitive. |
| Sun/shade | Main Area is open and south-facing -- sun by late morning, dries fast. Deep Woods and boulder corridors are shaded by canopy and house-sized blocks; stays damp 12--24+ hrs after rain. |
| Wind exposure | Sheltered. Forest canopy and boulder corridors block most wind. |
| Seepage after rain | Light rain: sunny boulders 2--4 hrs; overhangs may stay dry. Moderate rain: 24 hrs minimum; deep woods 36--48 hrs. Heavy rain: 48--72+ hrs for shaded sectors. Winter drying is slower due to low sun angles. |
| Best conditions | Cold and dry, mid-morning through early afternoon. Dew point below 40 deg F. |
| Worst conditions | Multi-day rain + overcast + no wind. Deep woods traps moisture indefinitely. |
| Best time of day | 10 AM -- 2 PM. Morning condensation clears by 10; afternoons rarely too warm in February. |

**Rain tip:** Roof-capped and overhanging problems (Midway V7, Super Mario V4) stay dry and are climbable even after spouts of rain. When rain hits mid-session, move to overhangs in the Main Area rather than packing up.

### [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md)

Coarse-grained ridgetop sandstone with high wind exposure and an elevation advantage -- dries somewhat faster than valley-floor areas but absorbs water deeply.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Coarse-grained sandstone. Rougher texture than Stone Fort; excellent friction but more abrasive on skin. |
| Humidity sensitivity | Moderate--high. Elevation advantage (2,200--2,330 ft) means often cooler and drier than the valley floor. Typically 5--10 deg F cooler than Chattanooga [UNVERIFIED]. |
| Sun/shade | Ridgetop with mixed forest. Multiple boulder orientations with no single dominant aspect. More sky exposure than forest-floor areas. |
| Wind exposure | Exposed. Ridgetop position on Pigeon Mountain. Wind chill can be brutal (40 deg F + 15 mph = feels like 32 deg F). Bring layers. Positive: rock dries faster and condensation is less persistent. |
| Seepage after rain | Standard 24--48 hrs. Coarse sandstone absorbs deeply. "Climbers must wait 24--48 hours for rock to dry completely after rain." |
| Best conditions | Cold, dry, low wind. Late morning through mid-afternoon (11 AM -- 3 PM). |
| Worst conditions | Heavy rain within 24 hrs. Fog/cloud at ridgetop (can be socked in when valley is clear). Very cold + windy (below 25 deg F wind chill). |
| Best time of day | 11 AM -- 3 PM. The 15--20 min approach provides a natural warmup; no need to rush early. |

**Drying advantage:** Ridgetop position plus wind exposure means somewhat faster drying than Stone Fort deep woods. Still needs a full 24+ hrs after moderate rain.

**Weather inversion warning:** Rocktown can be socked in with fog or low cloud when the valley below is clear. Check mountain-level forecasts, not just Chattanooga city forecasts, before committing to the drive.

### [HP40](../areas/hp40.md)

Smooth, fine-grained sandstone and the sloper capital of the Southeast -- the most humidity-sensitive of all Tier 1 areas, but magic when conditions align.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Fine-grained, smooth sandstone. "Smooth yet surprisingly grippy in cold conditions." Lowest skin abrasion of Tier 1 areas. |
| Humidity sensitivity | Very high -- highest of all Tier 1 areas. Slopers that are bomber at 40% RH become impossible at 65%+. Smooth rock relies on surface adhesion, not mechanical friction. |
| Sun/shade | Mountaintop with open and forested areas. "Shelter Boulders" provide wind protection; cliff-edge areas are wind-exposed. |
| Wind exposure | Moderate--high. Mountaintop on Chandler Mountain. Sheltered sectors available in trees and between boulders. |
| Seepage after rain | Standard 24--48 hrs. Smooth rock shows water marks (darker patches) more visibly than coarser stone. "If the ground is wet, the rock is wet." |
| Best conditions | Cold and dry, dew point in the 20s--30s. "HP40 will be magic." This is the day for sloper projects. |
| Worst conditions | Humidity above 55--60%, recent rain, warm afternoons above 60 deg F. The 2-hr drive from ESNP makes a wasted day costly. |
| Best time of day | Mid-morning through early afternoon. Wait for frost/dew to clear. Hand warmers recommended for cold mornings. |

**Dew point decision heuristic:**

| Dew Point | HP40 Outlook |
|-----------|-------------|
| Below 40 deg F | Excellent -- full send day for slopers |
| 40--50 deg F | Good -- most problems will feel fine |
| Above 50 deg F | Slopers compromised -- stick to crimps and edges |
| Above 60 deg F | Avoid HP40 entirely -- drive to Stone Fort or Rocktown instead |

**Time zone note:** HP40 is in Alabama and operates on Central Time (1 hr behind Chattanooga). Gate hours are 8 AM -- 6 PM CT. Depart Chattanooga by 7 AM ET to arrive at gate opening.

### [Dayton Pocket](../areas/dayton-pocket.md)

A sheltered gorge along the Richland Creek with roof-heavy climbing -- a secondary area that doubles as a viable rain-backup option.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Sandstone. Similar grain to Stone Fort [UNVERIFIED]. Roof features and pockets predominate. |
| Humidity sensitivity | Low--moderate. Sheltered gorge setting provides natural protection, though the gorge can trap humidity [UNVERIFIED]. |
| Rain resilience | High -- many problems are naturally sheltered from rain (overhanging/roof features). Potentially the best rain-backup area in the region. |
| Drying notes | Gorge floor may be muddy after rain; approach trail can be wet even when boulders are dry. |
| Drive from ESNP | 50--65 minutes. |
| Gate hours | 8 AM -- 7 PM. Gate is locked at 7 PM -- if you are still inside, you are locked in. |
| Access | Online climbing registration required through TN State Parks. |

**Key distinction:** The Vapor Roof is the signature feature -- Dayton Pocket is roof-climbing territory. The sheltered gorge setting means many problems stay dry during light to moderate rain, making this the go-to option when precipitation interrupts a day at an exposed area. However, the gorge floor and approach trail hold water, so expect muddy conditions underfoot even when climbable rock is dry.

### [Walden's Ridge](../areas/waldens-ridge.md)

The closest bouldering area to ESNP -- a quick-access option for short sessions or questionable-conditions days.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Pennsylvanian sandstone. Forested setting. |
| Humidity sensitivity | Moderate. Forest cover means slower drying than exposed ridgetop areas [UNVERIFIED]. |
| Drive from ESNP | ~25--35 minutes (shortest of any area). |
| Access | Public park; open access [UNVERIFIED gate status]. |

**Key distinction:** Walden's Ridge is not a destination area -- it is a convenience play. When conditions are questionable elsewhere, when the group wants a quick session without committing to a long drive, or when arrival/departure days leave only a short climbing window, Walden's Ridge fills the gap. The forest-covered setting means drying is slower than at wind-exposed ridgetop areas, so it is not the first choice after rain.

### [Hospital Boulders](../areas/hospital-boulders.md)

A large sandstone area near Gadsden, Alabama -- best paired with an HP40 day trip along the same corridor.

| Metric | Rating |
|--------|--------|
| Rock type | Sandstone. 200+ problems. Short approach. |
| Location | West brow of Lookout Mountain, near Gadsden, AL. |
| Drive from ESNP | ~1.5--2 hours (same corridor as HP40). |
| Conditions | Mountaintop position -- similar conditions considerations to other mountaintop areas (wind exposure, potential for fog/cloud). |
| Access | Dawn to dusk. Gate code required (obtain via SCC website form). Lock gate behind you. |

**Key distinction:** Hospital Boulders makes the most sense as an add-on to an HP40 trip, since both areas are along the same Alabama corridor. With 200+ problems and a short approach, it offers substantial volume. The gate-code requirement means planning ahead -- request the code from SCC before the trip, not the morning of.

## Crowds & Timing

### February Daylight & Timing

February days are short but gaining length through the trip window.

| Date | Sunrise | Sunset | Day Length |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| Feb 14 | ~7:20 AM | ~6:29 PM | ~11h 9min |
| Feb 17 | ~7:17 AM | ~6:32 PM | ~11h 15min |
| Feb 21 | ~7:13 AM | ~6:36 PM | ~11h 23min |

The practical climbing window runs roughly **~8:30 AM to ~5:00 PM**, shaped by multiple constraints:

| Constraint | Effect on Window |
|------------|-----------------|
| Sunrise (~7:15--7:20 AM) | No useful climbing light before ~7:30 AM |
| Morning condensation | Dew/frost can persist until 9--10 AM on shaded boulders |
| Finger warmth | Below ~35°F, most climbers cannot try hard |
| Peak friction | Typically 10 AM -- 2 PM (rock warmed above dew point, air still cool) |
| Sunset (~6:15--6:30 PM) | Usable light fades by ~5:30 PM |
| Gate closures | HP40 closes at 6 PM CT; Dayton Pocket at 7 PM ET |

**When does friction peak?** Overnight, rock cools to near or below the dew point, causing condensation. Morning sun warms the rock surface above the dew point, evaporating that moisture while the air temperature remains cool (40--55°F), keeping skin dry and chalk effective. This produces a peak friction window of approximately **10:00 AM -- 2:00 PM** on sunny February days. On overcast days without morning sun, the friction window may shift later (rock takes longer to warm above dew point) or may never fully open if the rock stays cool and damp all day.

### Crowd Avoidance Strategy

The trip runs Saturday Feb 14 through Saturday Feb 21 -- two weekends bookending five weekdays.

| Day | Strategy |
|-----|----------|
| Sat Feb 14 (arrival) | If climbing: choose less-popular area (Rocktown, Walden's Ridge). Avoid Stone Fort on Saturday. |
| Sun Feb 15 | Consider HP40 or Rocktown. Stone Fort still busy. |
| Mon--Fri Feb 16--20 | Prime days for Stone Fort -- weekday + peak friction = best of both worlds. |
| Sat Feb 21 (departure) | Quick session at Walden's Ridge (closest) or Stone Fort early before checkout. |

**Triple Crown competition warning:** The Triple Crown Bouldering Series holds events at Stone Fort and HP40 annually. If an event falls during Feb 14--21, that area will be extremely crowded. Check [triplecrownbouldering.org](https://www.triplecrownbouldering.org/) before the trip. \[UNVERIFIED -- 2026 dates not confirmed\]

## Skin Management

Skin is the primary limiter on a week-long sandstone trip. Southeastern sandstone is significantly more abrasive than granite or polished limestone — the compressed sand grains function like fine-grit sandpaper. Community consensus is clear: climbing hard every day for 7 days on sandstone means no usable skin by day 4--5. Managing skin through area rotation, pacing, and care products is not optional; it is the difference between a productive trip and a frustrating one.

### Rock Abrasiveness Comparison

Not all Chattanooga-area sandstone is equally abrasive. Texture varies meaningfully by area, and so does the rate at which each area eats skin.

| Area | Grain/Texture | Skin Impact | Dominant Style |
|------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) | Coarse-grained | Highest abrasion — rough texture eats skin fastest | Huecos, crimps, slopers, rails |
| [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) | Fine-grained bullet sandstone | Moderate — hard, dense rock wears skin steadily | Mixed: slabs, crimps, slopers, edges |
| [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) | Smooth, fine-grained | Lowest abrasion (smoothest of the three) — but compression/slopers mean high contact area | Slopers, compression, mantles |
| [Dayton Pocket](../areas/dayton-pocket.md) | Similar to Stone Fort \[UNVERIFIED\] | Moderate — roof climbing is finger-intensive | Roof pockets, pinches |

Grip style also determines where and how skin wears:

| Hold Type | Skin Impact | Areas Most Affected |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Crimps | Concentrated wear on fingertips; can create splits at joints | [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md), [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) |
| Slopers | Broad wear across pads and palms; raw thin patches | [HP40](../areas/hp40.md), [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) |
| Huecos/Pockets | Localized hot spots on specific fingers | [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md), [Dayton Pocket](../areas/dayton-pocket.md) |
| Compression | Friction across forearms, palms, and pads simultaneously | [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) |

### 7-Day Pacing Strategy

Skin is the primary limiter on a week-long sandstone trip. Community consensus: climbing hard every day for 7 days = no usable skin by day 4--5. The solution is deliberate pacing — moderate starts, strategic rest, and two peak-effort days rather than seven mediocre ones.

| Day | Effort Level | Strategy |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| Day 1 (Sat Feb 14) | Moderate | Reconnaissance and acclimatization. Do NOT project. "Take the first day to do a bit of volume at moderate grades to get used to the rock." |
| Day 2 (Sun Feb 15) | Moderate--hard | Ramp up but monitor skin. Stop if tips feel thin. |
| Day 3 (Mon Feb 16) | Full send | Skin is fresh, weekday crowds are low. Best day for hard sends. |
| Day 4 (Tue Feb 17) | Rest or light | Skin needs recovery. Active rest or very light climbing. Apply skin care overnight. |
| Day 5 (Wed Feb 18) | Moderate--hard | Refreshed skin. Pick smoother rock if tips are thin ([HP40](../areas/hp40.md) over [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md)). |
| Day 6 (Thu Feb 19) | Full send #2 | Second peak effort day. Focus on remaining projects. |
| Day 7 (Fri Feb 20) | Light or rest | Preserve skin for optional day 8. |
| Day 8 (Sat Feb 21) | Quick session or travel | If skin allows, one last morning session. |

Key principle: *"There's nothing worse than going through a tip on day 2 and not being able to try hard for the next few days."* Preserve skin early; go hard later.

### Area Rotation Strategy

Rotating between areas with different rock textures and climbing styles spreads wear across different parts of the hand and lets you match rock abrasiveness to your current skin condition.

| If Skin Is... | Go To | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Fresh (days 1--2) | [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) or [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) | Can handle coarser texture; full repertoire |
| Getting thin (days 3--4) | [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) | Smoother rock; less abrasive. Limit to 3--4 hours |

### Skin Care Tips

**Evening / rest day care:**
- **[Joshua Tree Climbing Salve](https://www.climbing.com/gear/7-balms-salves-and-tools-for-climbing-skin-care/)** — organic balm (beeswax, calendula, comfrey). Apply at night and on rest days.
- **ClimbOn Bar** — similar all-natural balm; widely available.
- **[Rhino Skin Solutions Repair Cream](https://natureclimbing.com/collections/rhino-skin-solutions)** — shea butter, tea tree oil, beeswax. Post-session repair.

**Pre-session care:**
- **[Rhino Skin Solutions Performance / Antihydral](https://www.climbing.com/gear/7-balms-salves-and-tools-for-climbing-skin-care/)** — reduces sweating. Use sparingly; overuse causes splits. Apply the night before a big send day, not morning of.

**During session:**
- Sand flappers/rough callus edges with a nail file or 220-grit sandpaper
- Liquid bandage (New Skin) + tape over splits for minor injuries
- Chalk liberally; shake out between attempts
- Limit sessions to 2--3 hours when skin is thin

**General rules:**
- File calluses smooth every evening (rough edges catch and tear)
- Moisturize at night (pliable skin resists splits better than brittle skin)
- Avoid soaking hands in water (softens calluses)
- Stay hydrated and eat well (nutrition affects skin healing)

### Skill-Level Notes

| Climber Level | Skin Risk | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| V0--V1 | Lower | Shorter problems, fewer attempts, lower intensity. Main risk is volume — 40 easy problems is still lots of contact. |
| ~V5 | Moderate | 5--15 attempts per project. Monitor hot spots on specific holds. |
| ~V10 | Higher | High-intensity contact, more attempts. Most likely to blow a tip on day 2--3. Pacing is critical. |

## February Seasonal Profile

### Temperature Range

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average high | 51--59°F (increasing through February) |
| Average low | ~35°F |
| Sweet spot for friction | 40--55°F (mid-morning to early afternoon) |
| Record lows | Can drop to single digits on cold fronts |

Mornings typically sit in the 30s to low 40s, with afternoons warming into the 50s ([Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/16944/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States), [climate-data.org](https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/tennessee/chattanooga-1852/)). Friction is best in morning cold when rock surface temperatures are lowest, but fingers may be too numb to climb effectively below ~35°F. The practical sweet spot is mid-morning through early afternoon, when temps sit in the 40--55°F range.

### Precipitation

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average total | ~4.1 inches |
| Rain days | ~13--14 days with measurable rain |
| Snowfall | ~1.85 inches possible (February is Chattanooga's peak snow month) |
| Trip impact | Expect at least 2--3 rain events during the 7-day trip |

Precipitation data from [weather-atlas.com](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/tennessee-usa/chattanooga-climate) and [climate-data.org](https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/tennessee/chattanooga-1852/). Southeastern sandstone needs a minimum of 24--48 hours to dry after rain. At Stone Fort, seepage from the bluff above can keep certain problems wet for days. Rain-response planning -- having alternate areas or rest-day activities ready -- is critical for a February trip.

### Humidity & Dew Point

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average relative humidity | 66--78% (varies by time of day) |
| Average dew point | 31--33°F |
| Morning pattern | Spikes 80%+ before sunrise |
| Afternoon pattern | Drops to 50--65% |

A dew point of 31--33°F is excellent for sandstone friction; the greasy threshold where holds start to feel slick is generally 55--60°F+ ([timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/chattanooga/climate)). February's dew points sit well below that line.

**The morning humidity trap:** Relative humidity spikes above 80% before sunrise, which can cause visible condensation on rock surfaces. However, because the dew point is low (31--33°F), rock warms above the dew point quickly once direct sunlight hits. East-facing boulders clear first. Plan early-morning sessions at east-facing walls, or wait until ~9:00--10:00 AM for other aspects to dry.

### Sunrise & Sunset (Feb 14--21)

| Date | Sunrise | Sunset | Day Length |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| Feb 14 | ~7:20 AM | ~6:29 PM | ~11h 9min |
| Feb 17 | ~7:17 AM | ~6:32 PM | ~11h 15min |
| Feb 21 | ~7:13 AM | ~6:36 PM | ~11h 23min |

Times from [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/chattanooga). Practical climbing window: **~8:00 AM to ~5:30 PM**. Morning condensation eats into the first hour of daylight, and fading light makes spotting unreliable after ~5:30 PM in wooded areas.

### Wind

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Average wind speed | 9--11 mph |
| Prevailing direction | Variable; channeled by Tennessee Valley topography \[UNVERIFIED\] |

9--11 mph is moderate ([Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/16944/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States)). Ridge-top areas (Rocktown, HP40) have significantly greater wind exposure than valley-floor areas (Stone Fort), which are sheltered by surrounding terrain and tree cover. Wind helps friction but hurts comfort -- bring a windbreaker for belaying and resting between burns.

### February vs. Ideal Conditions

| Factor | February Rating | Ideal for Climbing | Notes |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Temperature | Excellent | 32--50°F rock temp | Daily highs 51--59°F; mornings in the sweet spot |
| Dew point | Excellent | Below 40°F | Average 31--33°F; well below greasy threshold |
| Precipitation | Poor | None | ~14 rain days/month; biggest trip risk |
| Wind | Good | Light--moderate | Helps friction; can be cold on ridgetops |
| Daylight | Adequate | N/A | ~11 hours; short but sufficient |

February is peak bouldering season for southeastern sandstone. Low dew points, moderate temperatures, and low sun angles create friction conditions that climbers travel across the country to experience. The main risks are rain frequency and morning condensation -- not heat or humidity. Plan around rain ([NWS Chattanooga](https://www.weather.gov/mrx/) forecasts are the most reliable source for local conditions), keep a flexible schedule, and the odds of scoring at least several world-class sending days are strongly in your favor.
