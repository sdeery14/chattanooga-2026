## Low-Energy Climbing Sessions

Not a full rest day — the group has some energy but doesn't want a big day. These areas work for a short, close-to-lodging session that pairs with afternoon rest. All details are in the existing area profiles; this section helps you pick.

### Recommended for Casual Half-Day Sessions

| Area | Drive from ESNP | Approach | Fee | Best For |
|------|----------------|----------|-----|----------|
| [Walden's Ridge](../areas/waldens-ridge.md) | ~25-35 min | Short (within 1 mi of parking) | Free | Quick, no-commitment session |
| [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) | ~35-45 min | 5-15 min from parking | $10-12/day | Best overall half-day option |

### Walden's Ridge Park (~25-35 min)

Closest real bouldering to lodging. Free, no permits, public park. Multiple areas within a mile of parking. Strong V4-V6 selection (area's sweet spot) with V0-V3 warm-up options. The park also has MTB trails at the same location — a climber and a biker can go to the same place. See [trails/waldens-ridge-park.md](../trails/waldens-ridge-park.md) for riding.

**Limitations**: Minimal hard climbing (V7+). Still a developing area.

### Stone Fort (~35-45 min)

The most versatile area overall. Abundant problems at every grade. Short approaches (5-15 min from parking). Excellent for a "climb for 2-3 hours, then go get lunch" morning. Even V10 climbers can have a quality short session here (Now and Zen V7, Grimace V8, Cleopatra V8). V0-V1 climbers will have endless options in the Front Area.

**Limitations**: $10-12 day fee even for a short session. Slightly farther than Walden's Ridge.

### Not Recommended for Casual Sessions

- **Rocktown** (~50-70 min): Too far for a half-day. If you're driving that far, commit to a full day.
- **HP40** (~2 hrs): Way too far. Full-day destination only.
- **Dayton Pocket** (~50-65 min): Too far and too niche (roof climbing) for a casual session.
- **Hospital Boulders** (~1.5-2 hrs): Too far from lodging.

### Decision Shortcut

- **"We want to climb a little, close by, low effort"** → Walden's Ridge (free, close, easy access)
- **"We want a quality half-day with good problems at every grade"** → Stone Fort (worth the fee and the drive)
- **"Some climb, some ride"** → Walden's Ridge (MTB + bouldering at same location)

For full climbing area details, see [Bouldering Areas](../areas/README.md).

## Day Trips (~1 Hour)

Worth the drive if the group wants a change of scenery. Plan for a full day away.

### Sewanee, TN (University of the South)

College Town / Hikes — Cumberland Plateau (~60-65 min from lodging)

A small, charming college town atop the Cumberland Plateau with eclectic shopping, good food, and access to stunning hikes in South Cumberland State Park (30,000+ acres). The University of the South's campus features striking Gothic architecture on 13,000 forested acres. The vibe is quiet, academic, and distinctly different from Chattanooga — a genuine change of scenery.

**What to do there**:
- Walk the university campus (Gothic chapel, gardens, forested paths)
- Visit The Lemon Fair (local art, gifts, quirky finds in an old general store)
- Coffee at Stirling's Coffee House or lunch at The Blue Chair Cafe & Tavern
- Short hikes in South Cumberland State Park: Natural Bridge (25-ft sandstone arch, short walk) or portions of the Sewanee Perimeter Trail
- Mountain Goat Trail — paved multi-use path for walking or casual cycling

- **Cost**: Free-$$ (driving + food + optional shopping)
- **February note**: All outdoor trails open year-round. Sewanee sits at ~2,000 ft — expect 5-10°F cooler than Chattanooga. Some small businesses may have limited winter hours

### Fort Mountain State Park / Chatsworth, GA

State Park — Southern Cohutta Mountains (~50-55 min from lodging)

4,058 acres at the southern end of the Cohutta Mountains with scenic overlooks, a mysterious ancient stone wall of unknown origin, a lake, and hiking trails. Chatsworth (nearby town) is the "Gateway to the Appalachians." Pairs conceptually with a Rocktown or Zahnd day since it's in the same general direction (NW Georgia).

**What to do there**:
- Hike to overlooks and the ancient stone wall (multiple short trails)
- Scenic drive through the park
- Chief Vann House State Historic Site (Cherokee history tours) [UNVERIFIED winter hours]

- **Cost**: $ (parking fee)
- **February note**: Park open year-round, but lake and seasonal facilities closed. Hiking trails accessible. Call ahead for Chief Vann House winter hours
