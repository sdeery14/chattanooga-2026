# Zahnd Tract: Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Zahnd Tract](zahnd-tract.md)
> Uncrowded area near Rocktown with strong hard climbing around the Phantom Area. Lower grades need guidebook data — the area has 100+ problems but most are documented only in the Caffeine and Climbing guide.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Limited — but solid hard classics concentrated around the Phantom Area and Middle Blocs. Harvest Moon is the area's signature problem with strong community consensus.

### Phantom Area (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Harvest Moon** (V8) — Two-move problem; area's signature classic. [MP, RV Project, 8a.nu, KAYA]
- **Pray Like a Mantis** (V9) — Same start as Harvest Moon, moves out right. _Reach-dependent._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Harvest Moon Sit** (V9/V10) — Sit start extension. [MP]

### Middle Blocs (~8–12 min from parking)

- **Rhino** (V7) — Tension moves on roof and arete; from parking follow main trail to first break left. _Forested; generally shaded._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Rhino Low (Fire in the Sky)** (V10) — Low start extension of Rhino. _Forested; generally shaded._ [MP, KAYA]

### Other Areas

- **Castle in the Sky** (V7) — [KAYA]
- **Storm Crow** (V10) — [KAYA]
- **Ode to Austria** (V10) — [KAYA]

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Limited from web sources — only 2 named problems found. The V4–V6 range is described as the area's sweet spot by guidebook authors, but specific listings are in the Caffeine and Climbing guide, which was not directly accessed. Recommend purchasing for a Zahnd session.

### Razors Edge Area (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Razors Edge** (V6) — Amazing thin arete; area classic. [MP, Caffeine and Climbing]

### Phantom Area (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Razorback** (V6) — [MP]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Limited — no named V0–V3 problems found in web sources beyond one borderline entry. The area reportedly has easy climbing in grottos and along trails. Consult the Caffeine and Climbing guide for comprehensive easy problem listings. Alternatives for V0–V3 climbers: spot for hard climbers at the Phantom Area, explore the trail system, or combine with Rocktown (~15 min drive) for abundant easy options.

### Land of Aretes (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Holy Forrest** (~V3/V4) — Start on jug at lip, traverse left. [MP]
