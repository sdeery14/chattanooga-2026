# Sunset Rock (Sunset Park)

> **Tier**: Brief
> **Drive from lodging**: ~20–30 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area

## Overview

Sunset Rock is located on the western face of Lookout Mountain in Chattanooga. It is **primarily a trad climbing area** with 150+ routes (5.4 to 5.14) and a total ban on fixed protection. Bouldering exists at the base of the cliffs but is minimally documented and secondary to the rope climbing. **This is not a meaningful bouldering destination for this trip.**

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Negligible for bouldering
- One noted problem: Constellation Chaos (V8) on Lookout Mountain
- No structured boulder problem documentation in any major database
- The area's reputation and infrastructure is entirely built around trad climbing

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Limited [UNVERIFIED — some easy bouldering likely exists at cliff base but is not documented]
- V0–V1 climbers: the hike to Sunset Rock is pleasant and the views are excellent, but don't expect a bouldering session
