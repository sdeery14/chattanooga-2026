# Dayton Pocket: Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Dayton Pocket](dayton-pocket.md)
> Famous for the Vapor Roof — a massive horizontal roof with over a dozen hard variations. Specialist destination for roof climbing on pockets, pinches, and flakes.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Moderate — concentrated almost entirely on Vapor Lock Cave and the riverside boulders. The Vapor Roof is the main draw, offering a dozen hard roof variations from V7 to V10 in one sheltered spot.

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Limited — only 3 named moderate problems found in web sources. Reconciliation on the Vapor Roof is the gateway to the area's signature feature. Thin data honestly noted — ChattBloc 2nd Ed. likely documents more.

### Bridges Area (~5–10 min from parking)

- **Bedrocker** (V4) — Gym-like pockets. [MP]
- **Seduction** (V4) — Mid-grade classic. [MP]

### Vapor Lock Cave (~10 min from parking)

- **Reconciliation** (V5) — Gateway to the Vapor Roof. _Overhung/sheltered._ [MP, KAYA, Sendage]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Limited — only 2 named V0–V3 problems found in web sources. ChattBloc 2nd Ed. likely has more. The gorge hike is scenic and spotting on the Vapor Roof is engaging for non-climbers.

### River Area / Hillside (~5–10 min from parking)

- **Head Smacking Sound** (V0) — [MP, Sendage]

### Bridges Area (~5–10 min from parking)

- **Tollbooth** (~V3) [UNVERIFIED grade] — Under third bridge. [MP]
