# Dayton Pocket (Laurel Falls Bouldering)

> **Tier**: Supplementary
> **Drive from lodging**: ~50–65 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area

## Overview

Dayton Pocket is a river-gorge bouldering area west of Dayton, TN, famous for the Vapor Roof — a massive horizontal roof with over a dozen variations at V6 and above. With 150–219 documented problems on bulletproof sandstone, it's a specialist destination: if you love roof climbing on pockets, pinches, and flakes, this is excellent. If you don't, the hard climbing options thin out quickly. Best used as a half-day session paired with another area.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Moderate (concentrated on the Vapor Roof)
- The Vapor Roof is the signature feature with 12+ variations at V6 and above
- Classic hard lines: White Noise (V7), Riverdance (V9), Vapor Lock, 300
- Hard climbing is heavily concentrated on one feature — diversity of hard lines is limited compared to Tier 1 areas
- If roof climbing is your thing, this punches above its weight

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Moderate
- Problems exist along the river but are not as concentrated as Stone Fort or Rocktown [UNVERIFIED — exact count of easy problems not confirmed]
- V0–V1 climbers will find some options but may exhaust them in a half-day
- If easy climbing runs out: the gorge hike itself is scenic, and spotting on the Vapor Roof is engaging

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Moderate
- Decent mid-grade options scattered through the area
- The Vapor Roof variations start around V6, so strong V5–V6 climbers can sample the signature feature

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: Located in a river gorge alongside Richland Creek, with significant elevation change (~1,000 ft on approach)
- **Shade/Sun**: Gorge setting means shade in the morning, potentially damp conditions [UNVERIFIED — specific shade/sun patterns not confirmed]
- **Humidity tolerance**: River-side location means humidity and seepage can be issues. February cold should help offset this.
- **Best season**: Fall through spring. February should be good if cold and dry.
- **Rock type**: Bulletproof sandstone

## Logistics

- **Drive time**: ~50–65 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area (north, toward Dayton)
- **Parking**: Laurel Snow State Natural Area parking
- **Approach**: Hike with significant elevation change (~1,000 ft) to reach the bouldering. Not a quick approach.

## Access

- **Ownership**: Public land — Laurel Snow State Natural Area (Tennessee State Parks)
- **Fees**: Free, but daily online climbing registration is required for TN State Park climbing areas
- **Permits**: Online climbing registration required
- **Closures**: **The gate closes 30 minutes after sunset and the caretaker will lock you in** — plan your exit carefully. Central Time zone.
- **Etiquette**: No camping at the bouldering area. Respect the gate schedule.

## Style & Body-Type Notes

- The Vapor Roof is the defining feature: horizontal roof climbing on sculpted pockets, pinches, and flakes
- Extremely overhung — demands core tension, lock-off strength, and body positioning
- Riverside boulders offer more variety in style
- Roof climbing can favor climbers with strong core and pulling power regardless of reach
