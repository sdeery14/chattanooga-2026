> **Tier**: Supplementary
> **Drive from lodging**: ~45–55 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area [UNVERIFIED]

## Overview

Dogwood is a developing bouldering area on the Cumberland Plateau near Dayton/Graysville, TN, part of Cumberland Trail State Park. With 100+ problems, its sweet spot is the V3–V7 range — it's a moderate-focused area with some harder lines to V9 and first-ascent potential. Best for a session when you want quality mid-grade climbing on unique bullet sandstone without driving to Alabama.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Limited
- Problems to V9 exist with some first-ascent potential on unclimbed lines
- The area's strength is the V3–V7 range, not the upper end
- Not a primary hard-climbing destination

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Moderate
- Moderate range options available for easy climbing
- V0–V1 climbers will find some options but this isn't the deepest easy-climbing area
- If easy climbing runs out: the Cumberland Trail offers hiking nearby

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Strong
- This is the area's sweet spot — the V3–V7 range has the best concentration of quality problems
- V5 climbers will find the most rewarding sessions here

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: Cumberland Plateau elevation (~1,800+ ft)
- **Shade/Sun**: Forested setting with good shade
- **Humidity tolerance**: Bullet sandstone handles conditions reasonably well
- **Best season**: Fall through spring. February should be fine.
- **Rock type**: Bullet sandstone with unique features — patina incuts, technical slab, bulbous slopers

## Logistics

- **Drive time**: ~45–55 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area [UNVERIFIED]
- **Parking**: New public parking area off Bluffview Road
