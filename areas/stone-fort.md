## Overview

Stone Fort is one of the most versatile bouldering areas in the Southeast, with 600+ documented problems on bullet-hard Cumberland sandstone. Located on Mowbray Mountain in Soddy-Daisy, TN, it offers deep climbing at every grade — from beginner-friendly slabs to stout V10+ test pieces. If you could only visit one area on this trip, Stone Fort would be the safest bet for keeping the entire group engaged.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Strong
- Classic hard lines: Now and Zen (V7), A Face in the Crowd (V7), Grimace (V8, slopers), Cleopatra (V8), Spanky (V8, steep/technical with heady topout), Bedwetters (V9, roof)
- Grading reputation: generally considered fair to slightly soft compared to HP40 — a V8 at Stone Fort may feel like a V7 at HP40
- Hard climbing rewards body tension, precise footwork, and sloper technique on iron-rail features unique to this sandstone

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Abundant
- Huge concentration of easy to moderate warmups, particularly in the Front Area (100+ problems alone)
- Excellent for V0–V1 climbers — you will not run out of things to try in a full session
- Many problems have low landings and short approaches

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Abundant
- Deep selection across the entire boulder field
- Plenty of variety: slab, overhang, aretes, mantles
- Strong V5 climbers will find full days of quality climbing here

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: ~1,800–2,000 ft (Mowbray Mountain) [UNVERIFIED — exact summit elevation not confirmed]
- **Shade/Sun**: Forested boulder field provides good shade throughout the day
- **Humidity tolerance**: Humidity degrades friction in warmer months, but February should be excellent
- **Best season**: December through February is peak — cold, dry conditions maximize friction on the bullet-hard sandstone. Mid-February is prime.
- **Rock type**: Bullet-hard Cumberland sandstone with fine grain and distinctive iron rail features

## Logistics

- **Drive time**: ~35–45 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area
- **Parking**: Designated climber parking at the Montlake Golf Course clubhouse (9104 Brow Lake Rd, Soddy-Daisy, TN 37379)
- **Approach**: Short — most bouldering is within 5–15 minutes of parking

## Access

- **Ownership**: Private property — Montlake Golf Course
- **Fees**: $10 weekdays / $12 weekends (day use). Punch cards and annual memberships also available.
- **Permits**: Must sign a waiver at the clubhouse before climbing
- **Closures**: Closes at dark. Open year-round.
- **Etiquette**: Park in designated climber areas only; be respectful of golf course operations

## Style & Body-Type Notes

- Extremely diverse: slopers, compression, mantles, delicate footwork, overhang, aretes, slab
- Iron rail features running through the sandstone create unique holds found almost nowhere else
- Many topouts are committing — confidence on mantles is rewarded
- Not dominated by any single style; good for generalists
- Some slab problems reward precise, light footwork regardless of body type
