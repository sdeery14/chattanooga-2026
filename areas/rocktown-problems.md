# Rocktown: Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Rocktown](rocktown.md)
> World-class bouldering on coarse-grained sandstone atop Pigeon Mountain. Extremely diverse style range — slopers, huecos, iron rails, compression, roofs — with high problem density across all grades and strong friction dependence in cold/dry conditions.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Excellent. One of the highest concentrations of quality hard bouldering in the Southeast, with 13+ classic lines from V7 to V10 spread across multiple sub-areas. Style variety is exceptional — compression, dynos, roofs, slopers, heel-hook puzzles — so every session offers something different.

### Orb Area / Front Corridor (~5–10 min from parking)

- **The Orb** (V8) — Slopers, compression on a freestanding boulder; the most famous problem in the South. _Highly friction-dependent — cold/dry essential._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **The Vagina** (V8) — Sheltered between boulders; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Burst of Joy** (V9) — Power and technical blend on quality holds; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **B-Cubed** (V9) — Shallow holds, intense body tension; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Blackout** (V9) — Hard holds, front area; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Sherman Roof (~8–12 min from parking)

- **Sherman Photo Roof** (V7) — Roof climbing, undercling to crimp sequence. _Sheltered cave; climbable in light rain._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **Sherman Roof Traverse** (V9) — Full traverse of the roof; sustained endurance test. _Sheltered._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Comet Area (~15–20 min from parking)

- **The Comet** (V7) — Dyno to iron rails; powerful and committing. _Always shaded — good humid-day option._ V6 on Sendage (grade controversy). [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Sendage]

### The Valley (~15–20 min from parking)

- **Iron Claw** (V7; sit: V9) — Improbable heel hooks on an overhanging face. Bring lots of pads. _Needs dry conditions; stream-adjacent — avoid after rain._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **Golden Harvest** (V10) — Slopers and tension on a proud line; widely considered the best problem in the Southeast. Same boulder as Golden Shower V5 — ideal mixed-ability destination. _Cold/dry essential._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project, theCrag]

### The Maze (~15–25 min from parking)

- **Brown Hole** (V8) — Cave start to pocket finish; may favor reach. _Sheltered start._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Tractor Traylor** (V8) — Slab to roof transition; quieter area. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Abundant. The V4–V6 range is deeply stocked and covers virtually every style — arete, roof, pinch, crimp, iron rail. Several sub-areas cluster enough moderate problems for a full session without moving far.

### Orb Area / Front Corridor (~5–10 min from parking)

- **Soap on a Rope** (V4) — Arete with a tricky topout; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., KAYA]
- **Breaking and Entering** (V5) — Roof to awkward crux; close to parking. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Sherman Roof (~8–12 min from parking)

- **Nose Candy** (V6) — Crimps and pinches; near Sherman Photo Roof. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Comet Area (~15–20 min from parking)

- **The Variation** (V5) — Iron rail crimps on Comet Boulder. _Always shaded._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Standard Deviation** (V6) — Swoopy iron crimps on Comet Boulder; go-to V6. _Always shaded — cool iron rails in warm weather._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project]

### Asphalt Boulders / The Maze (~15–25 min from parking)

- **Pythagorean Theorem** (V5) — Undercling to triangle hold; trailside. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., KAYA]
- **Pinch Loaf** (V5) — Pinch-intensive; near Pythagorean Theorem. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Pullin' Tubes** (V6) — Near Pinch Loaf; Asphalt Boulders cluster. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Lab Rats** (V6) — Sharp sidepull; easier if tall. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### The Valley (~15–20 min from parking)

- **Golden Shower** (V5) — Most popular boulder at Rocktown; friction-sensitive with a committing topout. Same boulder as Golden Harvest V10. _Friction-sensitive._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., Mountain Project, KAYA]

### Police Brutality Boulder (~15–20 min from parking)

- **Police Brutality** (V5) — Deeper in the boulder field. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Helicopter Area (~20+ min from parking)

- **Inspired by an Idiot** (V6) — Roof climbing. _Sheltered; long approach._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Abundant. Excellent warm-up options spread across the area, with the Hueco Simulator offering a sun-exposed hub of juggy problems and the Comet and Maze areas providing shaded alternatives.

### Goforia Corridor (~5–10 min from parking)

- **Goforia** (V0) — Slab on a horizontal rail; great first climb of the day. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., KAYA]

### Hueco Simulator (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Makin' Waves** (V1–V2) — Juggy warm-up. _Sun-exposed._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed., KAYA]
- **Super Mario** (V3) — Pinches and slopers. _Sun-exposed._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **Belly Button** (V3) — Mono feature move. _Sun-exposed._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Comet Area (~15–20 min from parking)

- **The Standard** (V3) — Crimp test piece on Comet Boulder. _Always shaded._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Asphalt Area / The Maze (~15–25 min from parking)

- **Ripple** (V2) — Face on good edges. _Sheltered._ [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]
- **King Cobra** (V2) — Sit start, pockets to arete; Middle Maze. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Scoop Area (~10–15 min from parking)

- **The Scoop** (V2) — Balance and pocket finish; reach helps for the top. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

### Police Brutality Boulder (~15–20 min from parking)

- **Triple Slaps** (V3) — Deeper in field. [Kearney/Roper 2nd Ed.]

## Conditions Quick Reference

| Condition | Best Sub-Areas | Avoid |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| Humid / warm | Comet Area (always shaded, cool iron rails), Sherman Roof (sheltered cave) | Valley slopers (Golden Harvest, Iron Claw), The Orb |
| Cold / dry (ideal Feb) | Everything — peak season for all sub-areas | Nothing |
| After rain | Open areas dry fast (Hueco Simulator, Asphalt Boulders) | Iron Claw (stream-adjacent), low-lying Maze sections |

**Key tactical clusters**:
- **Comet Boulder** covers V3 (The Standard), V5 (The Variation), V6 (Standard Deviation), and V7 (The Comet) in one always-shaded spot — the best mixed-grade, all-conditions cluster at Rocktown.
- **Golden Harvest / Golden Shower boulder** in the Valley pairs V10 and V5 on the same rock — ideal for mixed-ability groups on cold/dry days.
- **Front Corridor** (Orb Area) stacks five V7–V9 problems within 5–10 min of parking — highest hard-climbing density per step at the area.
