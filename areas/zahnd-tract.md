# Zahnd Tract (Zahnd Natural Area)

> **Tier**: Supplementary
> **Drive from lodging**: ~50–60 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area

## Overview

Zahnd is a pleasant, uncrowded bouldering area on Lookout Mountain in Walker County, GA, with 100+ established problems on fine-grained sandstone. It sits just 15 minutes from Rocktown, making it an ideal addon to a Rocktown day or a standalone session when you want solitude. The area's strength is moderate climbing — it's not a destination for hard bouldering, but it has a few hard gems scattered among quality V0–V6 problems.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Limited
- A few hard gems exist: Harvest Moon (V8, two-move problem with sloping crimp rail), The Wave (V11/12, first climbed by Alex Savage), Razors Edge (V6)
- Some unrepeated hard problems and projects remain
- The concentration of quality V7–V10 lines is thin compared to Tier 1 areas
- Not a primary destination for hard climbing

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Moderate
- A decent selection of easy problems exists
- V0–V1 climbers will find things to do for a half-day session

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Strong
- This is the area's sweet spot — most established classics are in the moderate range
- V5 climbers will find the most rewarding climbing here

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: ~1,800–2,100 ft (Lookout Mountain)
- **Shade/Sun**: Forested with good shade. Less crowded than Rocktown.
- **Humidity tolerance**: Fine-grained sandstone handles humidity slightly better than coarse-grained rock, but cold/dry is still preferred
- **Best season**: Fall through spring. February should be good.
- **Rock type**: Fine-grained sandstone, characteristically grey and pebbly

## Logistics

## Style & Body-Type Notes

- Fine-grained sandstone ranging from vertical slabs and textured slopers to cavernous overhangs
- Pebbly rock texture creates a distinctive feel
- Narrow passageways and corridors between 30-foot boulders create a labyrinthine atmosphere
- More variety than one might expect for the size of the area
