# Stone Fort (LRC): Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Stone Fort (LRC)](stone-fort.md)
> Curated tick list for a February trip, grouped by proximity from parking. Stone Fort's 600+ problems on bullet-hard Cumberland sandstone offer deep climbing at every grade; this document narrows to ~35 priorities across the boulder field.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Strong — Stone Fort has a genuine concentration of quality hard lines from V7 through V10, spread across most sub-areas. February cold/dry conditions unlock the sloper-dependent problems that define the upper grades here.

### Front Area (~5 min from parking)

- **Tennessee Thong** (V7) — Steep, physical. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Spyro Gyro** (V7) — Cool holds, hard moves. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Poison Ivy** (V7) — Traverse into Black Carpet. _Needs dry conditions; check for seep._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Main Area (~5–8 min from parking)

- **Celestial Mechanics** (V7) — Dynamic big move off slopers. _HEIGHT-DEPENDENT: short climbers may need pad stacking to set up._ [Wellman 3rd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **A Face in the Crowd** (V7) — Face climbing; faces Grimace boulder. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Sherman Photo Roof** (V7) — Roof, undercling to crimp sequence. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Red House Extension** (V7–V8) — Linkup; grade varies V7 or V8 by source. [Wellman 3rd Ed., KAYA]
- **Grimace** (V8) — Sloper climbing on bullet sandstone; near Crack of Doom. _Needs cold/dry; degrades fast in humidity._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **The Orb** (V8) — Sit start, sloping pinches, mantle; sustained body tension. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Ace of Spades** (V9) — Main Area test piece. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Sternum Area (~8–10 min from parking)

- **Bedwetters** (V9) — Roof, compression. _Bad landing; bring extra pads._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **White Face** (V10) — Credit card crimping; near Ribcage V3 and Sternum V5. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Super Mario Area (~10 min from parking)

- **Cleopatra** (V8) — Near Super Mario V4. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Jungle Gym (~10 min from parking)

- **Jerry's Kids** (V7) — Tall, committing. _Damper microclimate; may need extra dry time._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Now and Zen Area (~12–15 min from parking)

- **Now and Zen** (V7) — Pinches, crimps, sidepulls in a shaded corridor. _Holds friction well in shade but corridor traps humidity._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Back Nine (~15+ min from parking)

- **Instinct** (V9/V10) — Grade discrepancy: listed V7, V9, or V10 depending on source. _Longest approach; farthest sub-area._ [UNVERIFIED — Wellman 3rd Ed., Sendage]

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Abundant — The V4–V6 range is Stone Fort's deepest grade band. You will not run out of quality moderates in a full day. Huge variety: cracks, caves, aretes, technical faces, and slopers.

### Front Area (~5 min from parking)

- **Black Carpet** (V4) — Slab/face. _Often wet or seepy; check conditions early in the day._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Genghis Khan** (V5) — Sustained, no rest; continuous movement. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **The Wave** (V6) — Slopey arete, core tension; technique over reach. _3.9/4 stars across sources. MUST-DO._ [Wellman 3rd Ed., Mountain Project]

### Main Area (~5–8 min from parking)

- **Tristar** (V4) — First-move crux, multiple beta options. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Art of the Vogi** (V4) — Technical face on vertical wall. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Prison Planet** (V4) — Overhang. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Crack of Doom** (V5) — Splitter hand crack. _Hand size matters for the jam; try it regardless._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Golden Shower** (V5) — Main Area. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Sternum Area (~8–10 min from parking)

- **Sternum** (V5) — Roof to mantle; next to Ribcage V3. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Super Mario Area (~10 min from parking)

- **Super Mario** (V4) — Cave sit start with kneebar; iconic Stone Fort problem. [Wellman 3rd Ed., Mountain Project]
- **Super Mario Extension** (V6–) — Extended linkup; considered soft for grade. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Jungle Gym (~10 min from parking)

- **Fat Cat** (V5) — Pockets, sidepulls, slopers. _Damper area; may need extra dry time._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Shotgun Area

- **Shotgun** (V6) — Pocketed face. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Back Nine (~15+ min from parking)

- **Cyclops** (V6) — Powerful moves; longest walk. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Abundant — 100+ problems in the Front Area alone at V0–V3. Excellent for warmups, for V0–V1 climbers filling a full session, and for mixing in between harder burns. Low landings and short approaches dominate this grade range.

### Front Area (~5 min from parking)

- **Spare** (V0) — Short slab; quick warmup. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **The Crescent** (V1) — Seam feature; good movement. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Fire Crack Flake** (V1) — Crack and flake system. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Storming the Castle** (V1) — Vertical wall, ~35 ft. _PG-13 rating for height; committing topout._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Mystery Groove** (V2) — Delicate, balancy. _Short and tall beta both work; body-type friendly._ [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Swingers** (V3) — V3/V4 border depending on source; Front/Main transition. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]

### Main Area (~5–8 min from parking)

- **Uncle Punchy** (V0) — Flakes; open and sunny. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
- **Block and Tackle** (V0–V2) — Grade debated; consensus around V1. [Wellman 3rd Ed., Mountain Project]

### Sternum Area (~8–10 min from parking)

- **Ribcage** (V3) — Sit start, roof to mantle; near Sternum V5 and White Face V10. [Wellman 3rd Ed.]
