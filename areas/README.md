## Quick Decision Filters

**Best for V7–V10 climbers**: HP40 > Rocktown > Stone Fort

**Best for the whole group**: Stone Fort (deepest easy + moderate pool) > Rocktown

**Closest to lodging**: Walden's Ridge (~25 min) > Sunset Rock (~20 min, but not a bouldering destination)

**Best if conditions are bad (humid/warm)**: Higher elevation areas — Rocktown (~2,200 ft) > Stone Fort (~1,800 ft)

**Best for a half-day session**: Walden's Ridge (close + no fee) or Dayton Pocket (pair with another area)

**Best rest-day addon**: Zahnd (pair with Rocktown, 15 min apart)

**Stone Fort rain-day alternative**: Cumberland / Pep Boys (same mountain, ~5–10 min away, dries faster)

**Skip in February**: Suck Creek (high water, submerged landings, cold creek crossings)
