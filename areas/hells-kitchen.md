## Overview

Hell's Kitchen is a promising but still-developing bouldering area near Graysville, TN, adjacent to Cumberland Trail State Park. Described as comparable to Stone Fort and Rocktown in rock quality, it features densely concentrated free-standing blocks, short cliff sections, and hidden corridors with potentially hundreds of problems. However, public information is thin, the approach is long (2 miles), and development restrictions are in place. **Not a confirmed primary destination for this trip, but worth monitoring.**
