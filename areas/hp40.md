## Overview

Horse Pens 40 is one of the premier winter bouldering destinations in North America, located on Chandler Mountain near Steele, Alabama. With 60+ problems at V8 and harder, it offers one of the densest concentrations of quality hard climbing in the Southeast. The compression-heavy, sloper-dominant style is unique and world-class. Part of the Triple Crown Bouldering Series. The drive is the longest of the primary destinations, but the hard climbing quality justifies it.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Outstanding
- 60+ problems at V8 and harder — one of the densest hard-climbing concentrations in the Southeast
- Classic hard lines: Litz Pocket Problem (V7), Ghetto Superstar (V8, crimps and slopers), Slider (V9, power endurance), Hot 'N Tot (V10)
- Grading reputation: considered **stiff** relative to Stone Fort — problems demand power, precision, and body tension
- The hard climbing here is world-class and worth the 2-hour drive

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Moderate
- Easy problems exist but HP40's reputation and primary appeal is in the harder grades
- A V0–V1 climber will find things to do but will exhaust easy options faster than at Stone Fort or Rocktown
- Consider pairing an HP40 day with spotting duties, exploring the park, or relaxing at camp

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Strong
- The V4–V7 range delivers some of HP40's best lines — powerful movement, subtle beta, and puzzling sequences
- V5 climbers will find excellent climbing, though the style is demanding

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: ~1,500 ft (Chandler Mountain)
- **Shade/Sun**: Forested area provides good shade
- **Humidity tolerance**: Slopers are stickiest in cold conditions — humidity kills friction here more than at crimp-heavy areas
- **Best season**: Fall through early spring. **February is peak season** — cold temps maximize friction on the smooth sandstone.
- **Rock type**: Smooth sandstone that is surprisingly grippy in the cold; water groove features are unique ("the sickest water grooves west of N.C.")

## Logistics

- **Drive time**: ~2 hrs from Enterprise South Nature Park area — at the outer edge of the driving radius
- **Parking**: On-site parking within the private park
- **Approach**: Short — boulders are scattered throughout the park grounds, most within a few minutes of parking

## Style & Body-Type Notes

- **The** defining characteristic: compression, slopers, water grooves, and body tension
- Steep, powerful, technical climbing that requires creative movement
- Many problems are short but intensely physical
- This is NOT a crimp area — it rewards power and body positioning over finger strength
- Some problems favor tall climbers due to wide spans on compression moves
- Water groove features are unique to HP40 and require specific technique
- Top-outs and mantles are famously committing
- Skin management is important — the sandstone texture can be abrasive over multiple sessions
