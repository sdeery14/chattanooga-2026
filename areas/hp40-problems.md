# Horse Pens 40 (HP40): Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Horse Pens 40 (HP40)](hp40.md)
> Curated tick list for a February trip, grouped by proximity within the park. HP40's compact layout, stiff grading, and world-class compression climbing make it one of the densest hard-bouldering destinations in North America; this document narrows to ~35 priorities across the boulder field.

## Grading Note

HP40 grades are **stiff and sandbagged** relative to most areas. Bumboy (V3) is the famous litmus test — many solid V5 climbers fail on it. The sloper-heavy, compression-dominant style inflates perceived difficulty for climbers trained on crimps. Expect every grade here to feel a notch harder than its number suggests.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Outstanding — 60+ problems at V8 and harder, one of the densest concentrations of quality hard climbing in the Southeast. February cold maximizes friction on the smooth sandstone slopers that define these grades.

### Skywalker Area (Upper — near parking)

- **Skywalker** (V8) — Compression to slopers; quintessential HP40 movement. _Same area as Merlin V1 and Genesis V3 — mixed-ability group._ [KAYA, MP]

### Upper Boulders (near parking/campground)

- **The Thief** (V7) — Entry-level hard; short walk from parking. [MP, Gripped]
- **Don't Rock My Boat** (V7) — Upper area classic. [KAYA]

### Flow Area (middle section)

- **The Flow** (V7) — Crimp start (unusual for HP40) into water groove and arete. _Sheltered start under roof; good option in marginal weather._ [MP]

### Lower Boulders — Millipede/Great White Cluster

- **Great White** (V7) — Widely considered HP40's "meat-wrappiest" problem; 3 stars theCrag. _Near Millipede V5 and Cuts Like a Knife V5._ [MP, theCrag]
- **Litz Pocket Problem** (V7) — Roof with shallow pockets. _SHELTERED from weather; shares finish with Cuts Like a Knife V5. Good rain/humidity option._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Ghetto Superstar** (V8) — Mixed crimps and slopers (unusual for HP40); wider style appeal for crimp-trained climbers. [MP, KAYA]

### Lower Boulders — Slider Area

- **Lawdog** (V8) — Powerful test piece. [MP, Blue Ridge Outdoors]
- **Slider** (V9) — **Most iconic hard problem in the Southeast.** Power endurance on crimps and slopers. _Friction-dependent; skin-shredding. Cold/dry conditions essential._ [MP, KAYA]

### Lower Boulders — Cadillac Thrills Boulder

- **Cadillac Thrills** (V9) — Same boulder as Red Arrow V3 and Hot 'N Tot V10. [MP, KAYA]
- **Hot 'N Tot** (V10) — Shares start with Cadillac Thrills V9. _REACHY crux — wingspan favors._ [MP, KAYA]

### Lower Boulders — Other

- **No Tranquility** (V9) — Competition classic. [MP]
- **Consumption** (V8) — Hard classic. [MP]
- **God Module** (V11) — Crimp and dynamic moves (unusual for HP40). _Included as an area benchmark; above the V10 ceiling of this list but too iconic to omit._ [MP]

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Strong — The V4–V6 range delivers some of HP40's best lines. Powerful movement, subtle beta, and puzzling sequences define these grades. The style is demanding even at moderate numbers.

### Upper Boulders (near parking/campground)

- **Honky Tonkin'** (V4) — Amazing arete. [MP, Gripped]
- **The Beach** (V4) — Arete with heelhooks. _Hip flexibility helps._ [KAYA, MP]
- **Hammerhead** (V5) — Arete, endurance; 4.4/5 KAYA. _Save energy for the top. MUST-DO._ [KAYA, MP]
- **Sandbox Sit** (V5) — Compression sit start of the V2. [KAYA, MP]
- **Trick or Treat** (V6) — Technical. _Shaded; good in warm spells._ [KAYA, MP]
- **Stepchild** (V6/V7) — V6 guidebook, V7 on KAYA; grade discrepancy. [MP, KAYA, Gripped]

### Upper Boulders — Ten Pins

- **Popeye** (V5) — Water groove intro; body tension. _Quintessential HP40 style._ [KAYA, MP]

### Lower Boulders

- **Lowdown** (V4) — Roof to mantle. _SHELTERED — good option in rain or strong sun._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Mortal Kombat** (V4) — Technical arete; precision footwork. [MP]
- **Man With a Slow Hand** (V4) — Classic HP40 moderate. [MP, Gripped]
- **Mulletino** (V5) — Powerful, near road. _Sketchy topout; commit or bail early._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Cuts Like a Knife** (V5) — Shares finish with Litz Pocket V7. [MP]
- **Millipede** (V5) — HP40's best squeeze problem. _SHORTER CLIMBERS and strong squeeze technique may have advantage._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Crisifix** (V5) — Technical. [MP, theCrag]
- **Redneck** (V6) — Iron cross, dynamic. _REACHY — wingspan favors._ [KAYA, MP]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Moderate — Easy problems exist but HP40's primary appeal is in the harder grades. A V0–V1 climber will find things to do but will exhaust easy options faster than at Stone Fort or Rocktown. These are warmups, rest-day fillers, and mixed-ability anchors.

### Skywalker Area (Upper)

- **Merlin** (V1) — Highball slab; 4.7/5 KAYA. _HIGHEST RATED problem at HP40 across all grades._ [MP, KAYA]
- **Genesis** (V3) — Undercling to pocket. _REACHY — favors taller climbers._ [KAYA, MP]

### Upper Boulders (near parking/campground)

- **Silky** (V0) — Perfect warmup. [Every Last Rock, KAYA]
- **Ketchup** (V1) — Intro to highballs. [Every Last Rock]
- **Sandbox** (V2) — Sandy arete to beach mantle. [KAYA, MP]
- **Copa Cabana** (V2) — Short overhanging arete. [KAYA]
- **Wasp** (V2) — Honeycomb pinches, tough topout. [KAYA, MP]
- **Eight Ball** (V2) — Classic HP40 topout experience. [Every Last Rock]

### Lower Boulders — Cadillac Thrills Boulder

- **Red Arrow** (V3) — Sloper topout. _Same boulder as Cadillac Thrills V9 and Hot 'N Tot V10 — mixed-ability anchor._ [KAYA, MP]

### Lower Boulders

- **Bumboy** (V3) — **The friction canary.** Stiff V3; many V5 climbers fail. 4.6/5, 127 ascents on KAYA. _If Bumboy feels impossible, conditions are bad for slopers — retreat to sheltered/crimpy problems. If it goes down clean, conditions are prime._ [KAYA, MP]

### Front Slabs

- **Boogey Wonderland** (V3) — Approachable V3. [MP, theCrag]

## Proximity Circuits (Mixed-Ability Groups)

These clusters let groups with different ability levels climb together without splitting up across the park.

### Skywalker Area Circuit

All within steps of each other near the upper parking area:

- Silky (V0) / Merlin (V1) / Genesis (V3) / **Skywalker (V8)**
- Range: V0 to V8. Everyone projects while staying within earshot.

### Cadillac Thrills Boulder Circuit

Same boulder, three different grades:

- **Red Arrow (V3)** / Cadillac Thrills (V9) / Hot 'N Tot (V10)
- Range: V3 to V10. The V3 climber spots for the V10 climber on the same rock.

### Millipede/Great White Cluster

Short walk between problems in the lower boulders:

- Millipede (V5) / Cuts Like a Knife (V5) / **Great White (V7)** / Litz Pocket Problem (V7)
- Range: V5 to V7. Litz Pocket shares a finish with Cuts Like a Knife — back-to-back burns on connected lines.

## Conditions Quick Reference

| Condition | Best Options | Avoid |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Cold/dry (ideal Feb) | Everything — prime sloper season; Slider V9, Bumboy V3 at their best | Nothing |
| After rain | Litz Pocket V7 (roof), Lowdown V4 (under roof), The Flow V7 (roof start) | Open slopers; Bumboy will be impossible |
| Humid/warm | Sheltered problems + crimp-dependent lines (The Flow V7, Litz Pocket V7) | All exposed slopers (Skywalker, Slider, Bumboy) |
| Skin shredded | Rest day or limit attempts; sandstone wears skin fast | Long endurance problems (Hammerhead, Slider) |

**Friction canary**: Try Bumboy (V3) early in the session. If it feels reasonable for its grade, sloper conditions are good. If it feels two grades harder, shift to sheltered and crimpy problems.
