# Cumberland Boulders (Pep Boys)

> **Tier**: Supplementary

## Overview

Cumberland Boulders (commonly called "Pep Boys") is a creek-side bouldering area on Mowbray Mountain — the same mountain as Stone Fort, accessed from a different trailhead (~5–10 min drive between them). With ~57 documented problems across 10 sub-areas, it's a concentrated, roof-heavy area known for "some of the most well-known roof problems in the Southeast." The signature features are the 7-11 Roof (V7–V10) and Hueco Roof. Quieter and more remote than Stone Fort — a tranquil alternative.

**Key advantage**: Cumberland's topography creates a wind-tunnel drying effect that airs out boulders faster than Stone Fort. When Stone Fort is still seeping after rain, Cumberland may already be dry.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Strong — concentrated on roof features
- 7-11 Roof: V7–V10 variations on a massive horizontal roof across the river
- Penthouse: V8–V9 pure roof lines with sloped landings
- Gross's Roof: V11–V13 elite-level
- Texas Toast: V9–V10 further hike (~20 min past Forty Five)
- Classic hard lines: Damn Yankees (V9), Walls of Illusion (V9), Southern Slang (V11), Mind Shift (V14 — Jimmy Webb FA)
- Style is heavily steep/overhung — demands core tension, body positioning, explosive power

## Grade Density

### V0–V3 (Easy)

- **Density**: Limited — ~5–8 named problems across Warm Up Boulder and Hueco Roof
- The Hueco Roof cluster (V1–V4) is the best zone for easier climbing
- Warm Up Boulder has 21 total problems including many unnamed V0–V3
- Not a primary destination for easy climbing — Stone Fort is 5–10 min away with 100x the density

### V4–V6 (Moderate)

- **Density**: Moderate
- Forty Five Boulders: 5 problems at V4 (Center 45, Forgotten 45, Left 45, Not Down With OPP, Treach)
- Riverfront: V4–V8 steep problems in shade across the creek
- Undercover Cutie (V5): Traverse with sloper finish

## Conditions

- **Elevation**: Mowbray Mountain, Cumberland Plateau edge
- **Shade/Sun**: Creek-bottom, mostly shaded by forest canopy
- **Humidity tolerance**: **Quick-drying** — wind-tunnel effect means faster drying than Stone Fort. Forty Five Boulders stay dry in light rain (steep overhangs)
- **Best season**: Fall through spring. Winter is prime season — February is ideal
- **Rock type**: Pennsylvanian sandstone and conglomerate — same as Stone Fort

## Logistics

- **Drive time**: ~35–45 min from ESNP area. On Mowbray Mountain, ~5–10 min from Stone Fort by car
- **Parking**: Mowbray Pike Trailhead, 809 County Highway 1126, Soddy-Daisy, TN 37379. Unmarked gravel pulloffs
- **Approach**: ~10–15 min walk via Cumberland Trail from parking. Boulders begin just past the power lines

## Access

- **Ownership**: Public land — Cumberland Trail State Park (Tennessee State Parks)
- **Fees**: Free. No permits required
- **Closures**: No overnight parking or camping. Exit by sundown. Pack out all trash
- **Etiquette**: Dogs on leash. No fires. Hide valuables in vehicles

## Style & Body-Type Notes

- **Heavily roof-oriented** — sustained steep climbing is the signature
- Demands core tension, lock-off strength, and body positioning on overhangs
- Hueco Roof problems feature large holds (huecos/jugs) — rewards reach and power
- Creek-side landings are uneven — pad placement and spotters important
- At 200 lbs: roof climbing is harder but Hueco Roof jugs offset the weight disadvantage
