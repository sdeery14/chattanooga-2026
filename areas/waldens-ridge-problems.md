# Walden's Ridge Park: Problem Clusters

> **Area Profile**: [Walden's Ridge Park](waldens-ridge.md)
> Closest bouldering to Chattanooga (~25–35 min). Opened 2023. Primarily a moderate-climbing destination with minimal hard options. Free, no permits, lowest-friction access of any area.

## V7–V10 (Hard)

> **Density**: Minimal — only 1 confirmed V7+ problem. Hard climbing is not this area's strength. See HP40, Rocktown, or Stone Fort for deeper V7–V10 options.

### Boy Scout Trail (~10–15 min from parking)

- **God's Gas** (V7) — Stand start: undercling/pinch to sloper compression, bump to lip, loaf rail feature, topout. [MP, KAYA]

---

## V4–V6 (Moderate)

> **Density**: Strong — this is the area's primary strength. Twelve quality moderate problems concentrated around the Upper Parking Area and Falls Connector, with the V4–V5 range particularly well-represented. _Forested; generally shaded._

### Upper Parking Area (~2–5 min from parking)

- **Handicap Parking** (V4) — [KAYA]
- **Epitaph** (V4) — Crimpy, technical vert. [KAYA]
- **Isosceles** (V4) — [KAYA]
- **Circumference** (V4) — [KAYA]
- **Compact Car** (V5) — [KAYA]
- **Eulogy** (V5) — [KAYA]
- **Stranger Danger** (V5) — Same sit start as The Upside-Down. [KAYA, MP]
- **The Upside-Down** (V6) — Sit start, compress both sides of roof to prow topout. [KAYA, MP]
- **Double Parked Dually** (V6) — [KAYA]

### Falls Connector (~8–12 min from parking)

- **Jet-Puffed** (V5) — [KAYA]
- **The Last Spot** (V5) — [MP, KAYA]

## V0–V3 (Easy)

> **Density**: Limited — only 1 named V0–V3 problem from web sources. An unnamed moderate slab at the Upper Parking Area is described as good for new climbers. The area is new (opened 2023) and still developing — more problems may be documented over time. Alternatives for V0–V3 climbers: hike to the waterfall, spot for moderate climbers at the Upper Parking Area, or use this as a warmup stop before a longer drive to Stone Fort or Rocktown.

### Boy Scout Trail (~10–15 min from parking)

- **Ok Joe, Right Foot Green** (V0) — [KAYA]
