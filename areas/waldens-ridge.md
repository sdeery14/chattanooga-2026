## Overview

Walden's Ridge is a 200-acre public park on Signal Mountain opened in 2023, making it one of the newest bouldering options near Chattanooga. With multiple bouldering areas accessible within a mile of parking and no fees or permits required, it's the lowest-friction option in the region. The area is still developing and is not a hard-climbing destination, but it's perfect for a quick local session when you don't want to commit to a long drive.

## Hard Appeal (V7–V10)

- **Density**: Minimal [UNVERIFIED — specific hard problem grades not confirmed]
- Named boulders include Marshmallow, V8 Juice, The Fin, Sleeping Dragon, Orange Mega
- The presence of "V8 Juice" boulder suggests V8-level climbing exists, but the area is not established as a hard-climbing destination
- Not a primary destination for V7–V10 climbing

- V5 climbers will have a full session of quality problems — this is the area's primary strength
