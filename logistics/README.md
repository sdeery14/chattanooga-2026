## Multi-Area Day Pairings

#### Alabama Corridor: [HP40](../areas/hp40.md) + [Hospital Boulders](../areas/hospital-boulders.md)

- **Total drive time**: ~4–4.5 hrs round trip (ESNP → HP40 ~2 hrs → Hospital Boulders ~30–40 min → ESNP ~1.5–2 hrs)
- **Why it works**: Both areas are on the I-59 Alabama corridor. Visit HP40 for the morning send window (10 AM – 2 PM CT), then stop at Hospital Boulders on the way back for a lighter afternoon session.
- **Timing**: Leave ESNP by 7 AM ET. Arrive HP40 at gate opening (8 AM CT / 9 AM ET). Climb HP40 until ~2–3 PM CT. Drive to Hospital Boulders (~30 min). Climb until dusk (~5:30 PM CT). Drive home.
- **Time zone note**: Both areas are Central Time.

#### Georgia Ridge: [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) + [Zahnd Tract](../areas/zahnd-tract.md)

- **Total drive time**: ~2–2.5 hrs round trip (ESNP → Rocktown ~50–70 min → Zahnd ~15 min → ESNP ~50–60 min)
- **Why it works**: Zahnd is only 15 minutes from Rocktown on the same Georgia ridge. If conditions at Rocktown are foggy or you want a change of pace, Zahnd offers a different vibe (uncrowded, fine-grained sandstone) with minimal extra driving.
- **Timing**: Visit Rocktown in the morning, Zahnd in the afternoon. Same WMA license covers both areas.

Source: Feature 001 area profiles, Google Maps estimates

#### Mowbray Mountain Cluster: [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) + [Dogwood](../areas/dogwood.md)

- **Total drive time**: ~2–2.5 hrs round trip (ESNP → Stone Fort ~35–45 min → Dogwood ~20–30 min [UNVERIFIED] → ESNP ~45–55 min)
- **Why it works**: Both areas are on the Cumberland Plateau north of Chattanooga with bullet sandstone. If Stone Fort is too crowded (weekend) or you've already spent several days there, Dogwood offers fresh problems in the V3–V7 range.
- **Timing**: Register at [dogwoodclimbing.com](https://dogwoodclimbing.com) before visiting Dogwood. [UNVERIFIED — drive time between Stone Fort and Dogwood]

Source: Feature 001 area profiles, Google Maps estimates

#### Quick Local: [Walden's Ridge](../areas/waldens-ridge.md) + Sunset Rock (viewpoint)

- **Total drive time**: ~1–1.5 hrs round trip (ESNP → Walden's Ridge ~25–35 min → Sunset Rock ~15 min → ESNP ~20–30 min)
- **Why it works**: Both are on/near Signal Mountain/Lookout Mountain. Climb at Walden's Ridge in the morning, then catch the sunset viewpoint at Sunset Rock (scenic, not for bouldering). Good for arrival/departure days or rest-day half-sessions.
- **Timing**: Free access at both. No registration required for Walden's Ridge.
