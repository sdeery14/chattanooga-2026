## Mountain Biking

### Trail Wishlist

> **Your bike**: Jamis Faultline A2 (120/130mm FS 29er) — perfect for flow through moderate tech. Skip gravity/DH lines.
> **Your goal**: Flow/XC for fun + trail/enduro for skill development.

| Rank | Trail | Drive | Miles | Character | Purpose | Bike Fit | Feb Drainage | Pairing | Profile |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-----------|---------|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| **1** | **White Oak Mountain** | 15–25 min | 25 mi | Machine-built flow, stacked loops, 25-jump progression trail | Both | Perfect | Excellent | All areas (central) | [Profile](trails/white-oak-mountain.md) |
| **2** | **Enterprise South** | 0 min | 15 mi | Flow, jumps, rhythm, pump track | Both | Perfect | Good | Home base — always available | [Profile](trails/enterprise-south.md) |
| **3** | **Coldwater Mountain** | 3–3.5 hrs (55 min from HP40) | 50–56 mi | IMBA Bronze, Bomb Dog flow trail | Flow/Fun | Perfect | Excellent | HP40 day only | [Profile](trails/coldwater-mountain.md) |
| **4** | **Raccoon Mountain** | 30–40 min | 28–30 mi | Tech singletrack, 6 mi Green loops | Skill Dev | Adequate | Moderate–Good | Stone Fort fallback | [Profile](trails/raccoon-mountain.md) |
| **5** | **Stringer's Ridge** | 20–30 min | 7 mi | Urban, pump track, Green–Blue | Skill Dev | Perfect | Moderate | Quick evening session | [Profile](trails/stringers-ridge.md) |
| **6** | **Five Points** | 45–55 min | 20–25 mi | Diverse, Green–Black, industrial character | Both | Adequate | Unknown | Rocktown/Zahnd day | [Profile](trails/five-points.md) |

**Key trails at top systems**:
- **White Oak**: Black Forest (Green warmup) → TNT (Blue jumps) → 25-jump progression trail → work up to Double Black
- **Enterprise South**: Pump track (daily skills) → Black Forest (Green) → TNT (Blue) → Atlas (Black progression)
- **Coldwater**: Bomb Dog (Blue) — signature flow trail, perfect for your level

**Skip for this trip**:
- Booker T. Washington — poor drainage, technical not flow, only 7 mi
- Walden's Ridge Park — gravity/DH, wrong style + bike. DO NOT RIDE WET
- Lookout Mountain — descent-oriented, technical, unverified access
- Pigeon Mountain — WMA hunting restrictions make February access uncertain
- Chickamauga Battlefield — paved roads, not MTB (rain-day fallback only)
- Oak Mountain — 2.5 hrs each way, no climbing pairing possible

### Walden's Ridge Park

> [Area Profile](areas/waldens-ridge.md) | [Problem Clusters](areas/waldens-ridge-problems.md)
> Closest bouldering to lodging (~25–35 min). Opened 2023, still developing. ~194 problems across 20 sub-areas. **Far more V0–V3 than originally documented** — 50+ easy problems, not just 1.
> Also has MTB trails — you can climb and ride in the same session here.

**Send List** — High-confidence sends for your profile:

| Problem | Grade | Sub-Area | Walk | Why It Suits You | Landing | Flags |
|---------|-------|----------|------|------------------|---------|-------|
| Toy Car | V0 | Upper Parking | ~2 min | Right at the car — instant warmup | OK | ⚠️ Tight hallway landings between stacked boulders — place pads carefully |

| **East Arete** | V3 | Creekside | ~12 min | "Fantastic arete-squeeze." Balance, techy sidepulls, crimps, good footwork. Sit start. 12 ft. Arete rewards reach | Good | Creekside — check for damp landing |
| Slope Rider | V3 | BTW Boulder | ~10 min | Well-rated V3 on the main boulder | Good | — |

> **Bonus**: Walden's Ridge has MTB trails on-site. You can climb for a few hours and ride the same afternoon without moving your car. The Gravestone Boulder has "a perfect beginner's slab on one side, and progressively steeper bulges and faces on the other" — great for progression.
>
> **February note**: Sandstone friction is excellent in cold/dry weather. Creek crossings can be icy. Stick to Upper Parking, BTW Boulder, and Gravestone for driest conditions. The Waterfall Area will be wetter.
>
> **Caution**: Park opened 2023, still developing. Landing zones may have loose rock from limited traffic. Test landings before committing.

### Cumberland Boulders / Pep Boys

> No area profile in repo — this area was outside original scope. On Mowbray Mountain, same as Stone Fort. ~57 problems, heavily roof-oriented. **Quick-drying** — wind-tunnel effect makes it a good rain-day alternative when Stone Fort is still seeping.

**Honest Assessment for Your Level**: Cumberland/Pep Boys is a **roof-heavy area** where the signature problems are V7–V13. Only ~5–8 problems exist at V0–V3. That said, the Hueco Roof cluster has one genuine classic worth trying.

| Problem | Grade | Sub-Area | Walk | Why It Suits You | Landing | Flags |
|---------|-------|----------|------|------------------|---------|-------|
| Peanut Gallery | V1 | Hueco Roof | ~10–15 min | Roof on jugs — warmup for the area | OK | ⚠️ Creek-side setting — uneven landing, pad placement matters |
| Ear | V2 | Warm Up Boulder | ~10 min | First boulders you reach — good intro | OK | — |
| Finagler | V2 | Hueco Roof | ~10–15 min | Roof at approachable grade | OK | Creek-side landing |
| **Hueco Roof Right** | **V3** | Hueco Roof | ~10–15 min | **"Surf jugs and battle the top."** 9 ft. Classic roof on big holds — reach and power are exactly what this needs. (3.1 stars, 86 votes — most popular easy problem in the area) | OK | ⚠️ Roof fall = horizontal landing. Spotter recommended. Creek-side pad placement |
| Hatchet | V4 | Lower Suck/Paul Bunyan | ~15 min | "Engineer big moves straight up" from undercling. 7 ft tall. Power + reach friendly | OK | On the Paul Bunyan bloc — creek-side |

**When to go here**: Visit Cumberland/Pep Boys as a **Stone Fort add-on** (same mountain, ~5–10 min drive between them). Best reason to come: Stone Fort is wet but Cumberland is dry (wind-tunnel drying effect). Spend 1–2 hours working the Hueco Roof V1–V4 cluster while your partners project the V7+ roofs. **Do not plan a full day here at your level** — you'll run out of suitable problems.

> **February note**: Creek-side landings may be damp. Sandstone rules apply — don't climb wet rock. No fees, no permits. Tennessee State Parks rules.

### Tier 2 Quick Notes

> Honest assessments for areas without full curated sections. No filler.

| Area | V0–V3 Count | Verdict | Notes | Profile |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|---------|
| **Hospital Boulders** | 7 | **Worth climbing** | Best Tier 2 for easy grades. Good rest-day or mixed-ability destination. Short approaches | [Profile](areas/hospital-boulders.md) / [Problems](areas/hospital-boulders-problems.md) |
| Dayton Pocket | 2 | Ride or spot | Only 2 named V0–V3. Primary appeal is V5+ roof climbing | [Profile](areas/dayton-pocket.md) |
| Zahnd Tract | 1 | Ride or spot | 1 borderline V3/V4. Pair with Rocktown for your climbing | [Profile](areas/zahnd-tract.md) |
| **Foster Falls** | 1 | **Skip** | Sport climbing area, not bouldering. Only 6 total boulder problems (1 at V1–2: Dizzy Arete). ~50–60 min drive + steep gorge approach + creek crossing. Not worth the trip for 1 easy problem. Knee risk on gorge descent |
| **Suck Creek** | 2–3 | **Skip (especially February)** | Hard area (V5–V14 core). Only 2–3 V0–V2 problems. Trail-less approach with creek crossings — **February = high water, submerged landings, cold crossings.** Bad for ACL history. Area is at its worst this time of year. Come back in summer if curious |

**Tall/Powerful-Friendly Picks (All Areas)**:

| Problem | Grade | Area | Why You Have an Advantage |
|---------|-------|------|--------------------------|
| **Genesis** | V3 | HP40 | REACHY — favors taller climbers. Undercling to pocket |
| **NW Arete** | V2 | Walden's Ridge | "Works for short and tall climbers." Arete climbing rewards reach |
| **The Scoop** | V2 | Rocktown | Reach helps for the top |
| **Mystery Groove** | V2 | Stone Fort | Body-type friendly — short and tall beta both work |
| **Hueco Roof Right** | V3 | Cumberland/Pep Boys | Roof on big jugs — reach + power is exactly what this needs |
| Redneck | V6 | HP40 | REACHY — wingspan favors. (Moonshot territory — probably not this trip) |

## Personal Logistics

### Bike Transport

- Rack: Confirm hitch rack / roof rack fits the Faultline A2 (XL frame, 29" wheels)
- Remove dropper post remote and any loose accessories before racking
- Pre-trip checklist:
  - [ ] Tire pressure (front: ~25–28 psi, rear: ~27–30 psi for trail)
  - [ ] Brake pads — check pad life, bring spares if low
  - [ ] Dropper post function — full travel, no sticking
  - [ ] Chain lube — fresh application night before departure
  - [ ] Thru-axle torque — snug, not overtight
  - [ ] Suspension sag — verify 25–30% sag front and rear
  - [ ] Shock lockout works (climb mode for road transfers)

### Gear Checklist

**Bike Gear**:
- [ ] Helmet (mandatory)
- [ ] Gloves (full-finger for trail/enduro skill work)
- [ ] Flat pedals + riding shoes (or clip-ins if you prefer)
- [ ] Spare tube (29" — match your tire width)
- [ ] Mini pump or CO2 inflator
- [ ] Multi-tool with chain breaker
- [ ] Chain quick-link (Shimano 11-speed)
- [ ] Tire levers
- [ ] Small first-aid kit (trail-side)

**Climbing Gear**:
- [ ] Climbing shoes (broken in — not new for the trip)
- [ ] Chalk bag + chalk
- [ ] Brush (boar's hair for sandstone)
- [ ] Crash pad contribution (coordinate with group — see [Logistics Guide](logistics/README.md))
- [ ] Athletic tape (fingers + skin management)

**Personal**:
- [ ] Knee braces/sleeves (both knees — wear for highballs and any sketchy approaches)
- [ ] Hip stretching bands (resistance bands for hip mobility routine)
- [ ] Foam roller (or tennis ball for hip flexors/IT band)
- [ ] Ibuprofen / anti-inflammatory (as needed, not prophylactic)
- [ ] Sunscreen (February sun still burns on exposed rock)
- [ ] Headlamp (White Oak Mountain trails open until 10 PM)

### Knee/Body Notes

**Pre-Session Warmup** (10–15 min before climbing or riding):
1. Hip circles and leg swings (20 each direction)
2. ATG split squats (5 each leg — knees-over-toes warm up)
3. Ankle rotations and calf raises
4. Light bouldering on V0/VB for 10 minutes before projecting

**Landing Assessment Protocol** (for highballs):
- Before committing: Stand at the base and visualize a fall from the top
- Can you land feet-first on flat ground with pad coverage? If not, **skip it**
- Merlin (V1, HP40) and Storming the Castle (V1, Stone Fort) specifically need this assessment
- When in doubt, spot from below and let someone else try it first

**Hip Mobility Routine** (do nightly):
1. 90/90 hip stretch (1 min each side)
2. Pigeon pose (1 min each side)
3. Frog stretch (1 min)
4. Couch stretch for hip flexors (1 min each side)
5. Foam roll IT band and quads (2 min each leg)

**When to Call It**:
- If you're falling on every attempt → fatigue is setting in → bad landings → knee risk
- If hips feel locked up and you can't flag or step high → switch to power-only problems or call it
- If a knee feels "off" after a landing → stop climbing, ice it, ride the bike instead (low-impact)
- Remember: this is a week-long trip. Better to climb 6 days at 80% than 3 days at 100% + 3 days injured
