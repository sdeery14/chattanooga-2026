## Conditions

- **Drainage**: Moderate-good. Rocky terrain helps drainage; reputation for being rideable "shortly after rain." However, SORBA closes trails during heavy rain or freeze/thaw -- do NOT ride when muddy.
- **Freeze/thaw**: Moderate concern -- mountaintop location means colder temps than valley trails.
- **February outlook**: Check [SORBA Chattanooga](https://www.sorbachattanooga.org/localtrails) for closures before driving out.

## Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: 3 trailhead parking areas on top. **Laurel Point** is best (restrooms, bike wash, repair stand, changing rooms, water fountain). East Overlook and Switchyard also available. Do NOT park at the TVA Visitor's Center.
- **Fees**: Free (TVA land)
- **February status**: Open year-round, sunrise to sunset. Subject to SORBA trail closures based on conditions.
- **Hours**: Sunrise to sunset
