## Overview

Chattanooga's first purpose-built, progressive downhill trail system, designed and constructed by IMBA Trail Solutions across 200 acres with 800-900 feet of elevation loss. This is a gravity/downhill-oriented park — not a XC/pedal system — best suited for riders who want DH and enduro riding with drops, rock rolls, jump lines, and flowing singletrack.

## Trails & Difficulty

- **Difficulty**: Blue (intermediate) through Double Black (expert), emphasis on intermediate and advanced gravity riding
- **Miles**: ~10 miles across 20 mapped trails (Trailforks)
- **Key trails**: "Biscuits and Gravy" (jumps, drops, rock gardens, flow), "Bread and Butter" (flow)
- **Style**: Gravity-fed descending. Shuttle or pedal up, ride down.

Shuttle service available through Chattanooga Guided Adventures ($35/day, $10/single run).

## Conditions

- **Drainage**: Poor to moderate. The park explicitly states: **"DO NOT RIDE WET TRAILS!"** Avoid after rain.
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: HIGH. Mountaintop location means gravity trails are severely damaged by riding during thaw cycles. Check conditions before driving up in February.
- **Sun/shade**: Forested mountain slopes, mostly shaded.
