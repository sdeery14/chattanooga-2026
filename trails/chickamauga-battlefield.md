## Overview

This is **not mountain biking singletrack** — Chickamauga Battlefield is road and gravel riding on park roads through a historic Civil War battlefield. It is included as the "always rideable" fallback option: flat, easy, scenic, and fully rideable on paved roads regardless of weather. Best for recovery rides, rain-day alternatives, non-MTB days, or exploring with no trail-skill requirement.

## Trails & Difficulty

- **Total rideable miles**: ~27 miles (22 mi paved park roads + 5 mi gravel/earthen roads)
- **Difficulty**: Easy — flat to gently rolling terrain throughout
- **Rating system**: N/A (road/gravel riding, not rated on IMBA singletrack scale)

**Key routes:**

| Route | Surface | Distance | Time Estimate |
|-------|---------|----------|---------------|
| Historic Bike Tour Route | Paved | ~12.6 mi | ~1-1.5 hrs |
| Full paved road network | Paved | ~22 mi | ~2-3 hrs |
| Gravel/earthen roads | Gravel | ~5 mi | ~30-45 min |
| All roads combined | Mixed | ~27 mi | ~3-4 hrs |

- The park has ~70 interpretive pull-offs along the paved roads
- Mostly flat with one notable hill at Horseshoe Ridge / Snodgrass Hill
- Car traffic is slow but road shoulders are rare — stay alert
- NPS offers free guided bike tours in spring-fall (not available in February)

## Conditions

- **Drainage (paved roads)**: Excellent — always rideable regardless of weather
- **Drainage (gravel roads)**: Fair — may be muddy after rain
- **Freeze/thaw**: N/A for paved roads; gravel roads may soften in freeze/thaw cycles
- **February notes**: Paved roads are the primary draw and are rideable in any conditions. Gravel roads are a secondary option best saved for dry days. This is the go-to option when singletrack systems across the region are closed due to wet or freezing conditions.

## Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Multiple lots throughout the park. Best starting points for gravel riding: McFarland Gap Road lots. Visitor Center parking also available.
- **Fees**: Free (NPS — no entrance fee)
- **February status**: Open year-round
- **Hours**: 6 AM to sunset, 7 days/week
