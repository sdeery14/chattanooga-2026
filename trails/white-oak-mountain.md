> **Location**: Southern Adventist University, Collegedale, TN (east of Chattanooga, near Ooltewah)
> **Drive from lodging**: ~15-25 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area

## Overview

The best all-around trail system near ESNP for variety, with ~25 miles of stacked loops that flow from beginner to expert as you ride deeper into the network. Machine-built flow trails plus natural tech on the Southern Adventist University campus, with excellent drainage that makes it one of the top post-rain riding options in the entire Chattanooga area.

## Trails & Difficulty

- **Difficulty**: Green (beginner) through Double Black Diamond (expert)
- **Miles**: ~25 miles in a stacked loop system
- **Layout**: Easiest trails closest to parking, hardest furthest away. An intermediate rider can handle everything except White Oak Ridge and Points Unknown (double black diamond).

- **Estimated ride time**: 1.5-3+ hours depending on how deep you go.
