# Booker T. Washington State Park

> **Location**: 5801 Champion Rd, Chattanooga, TN 37416 (Harrison / Chickamauga Lake — NE Chattanooga)
> **Drive from lodging**: ~10-15 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area
> **Nearby climbing**: [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) (~35-45 min NW)

## Overview

Booker T. Washington offers ~7.3 miles of technical, natural singletrack across three loops on the shore of Chickamauga Lake. The trails are gnarly, twisty, and rooty with steep climbs, fast downhills, and off-camber banked turns — more challenging than the short mileage suggests. Due to its proximity to ESNP and poor wet-weather drainage, this is best as a "short ride nearby" option when you want scenic lake views and a change of scenery rather than a full destination ride.
