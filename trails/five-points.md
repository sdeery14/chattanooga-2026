## Overview

A diverse, destination-quality trail system built through an old coal mining area atop Lookout Mountain, offering ~25 miles of interconnected singletrack with unique industrial character — stacked boulders, coal pilings, abandoned mine features, and steep terrain. More secluded and less crowded than other Chattanooga-area trails.

## Trails & Difficulty

- **Miles**: ~20-25 miles of interconnected singletrack
- **Key trails**: Slickenslide (air time), Caprock (rock gardens), Tailings Run (abandoned mine)
- **Style**: Steep climbs, rolling descents, technical features. Good variety from mellow to gnarly.
- **Connections**: Links to the Chattanooga Connector Trail (CCT) system and Cloudland Canyon State Park.
- **Estimated ride time**: 2-4 hours for a full tour.

## Conditions

- **Drainage**: UNKNOWN [UNVERIFIED]. Mountaintop sandstone plateau likely drains reasonably, but no specific drainage info confirmed.
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Moderate to high due to mountaintop elevation.
- **February note**: Check local trail reports before making the drive — no drainage data means conditions are unpredictable after rain or freeze/thaw.
