# Mountain Biking: Chattanooga Region

> Quick reference for trail selection. All drive times from Enterprise South Nature Park area (lodging).
> Trip dates: February 14–21, 2026.

## February Riding Conditions

Trails in the Chattanooga area are **generally rideable in February** but with important caveats:

- **Freeze/thaw is the #1 concern.** Trails frozen in the morning become a sloppy mess by mid-morning as temps rise. Riding during thaw creates deep ruts that persist for years. **Ride early (frozen = OK) or wait for full thaw and dry-out.**
- **Post-rain recovery**: Most trails need 24-36 hours to dry after significant rain. **If your tires leave ruts deeper than 1/2 inch, turn around.**
- **No blanket seasonal closures** in the Chattanooga area — trails close situationally based on conditions.
- **Check [SORBA Chattanooga](https://www.sorbachattanooga.org/) daily** for current trail status before riding.

### Wet-Weather Fallbacks

| Option | Drive | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| [White Oak Mountain](white-oak-mountain.md) | ~15-25 min | Drains "VERY well" — the go-to after rain |
| [Enterprise South](enterprise-south.md) | 0 min | Rock-lined trails drain quickly (some muddy spots in drainages) |
| [Chickamauga Battlefield](chickamauga-battlefield.md) | ~25-35 min | Paved roads — always rideable regardless of weather. Not singletrack. |
