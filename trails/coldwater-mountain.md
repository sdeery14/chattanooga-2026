## Overview

Coldwater Mountain is an IMBA Bronze Level Ride Center and National Recreation Trail with ~50-56 miles of purpose-built singletrack designed by IMBA Trail Solutions. It offers a full IMBA progression from beginner loops to expert gravity descents across red-dirt and rocky terrain. This is the primary recommended HP40 pairing — a "split from the group" option where the biker drives to HP40 with the climbing group, splits off for the ~55 min drive to Coldwater, rides a world-class trail system, and returns or drives back to Chattanooga separately.

## Trails & Difficulty

- **Total rideable miles**: ~50-56 miles of purpose-built singletrack
- **Difficulty range**: Green through Black (full IMBA progression)
- **Rating system**: Standard IMBA

**Key trails:**

| Trail | Rating | Distance / Notes |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Mama Bear / Papa Bear / Baby Bear | Green | Beginner loops, family-friendly |
| Bomb Dog | Blue | Signature flow trail — iconic views, swoopy turns |
| Southern Traverse | Blue | ~8.5 mi, major expansion trail |
| Gazza | Black | Expert descent — rocky, technical |
| Gravity trails | Black | ~2 mi dedicated purpose-built downhill |

**Suggested sessions:**

- **Bomb Dog + connector loops**: ~1.5-2 hrs, solid intermediate session
- **Full perimeter loop**: ~3-5 hrs depending on skill and fitness

## Conditions

- **Drainage**: Excellent. Rocky terrain sheds water very well — "no puddles to speak of" after multiple days of rain. The system is rarely officially closed due to weather.
- **Exception**: The connector trail from Bomb Dog to the base is clay and drains poorly. Avoid this section after heavy rain.
- **Freeze/thaw**: Minimal concern — lower latitude and elevation than Chattanooga. Mild Alabama winters.
- **February notes**: One of the most weather-resilient systems in the region. Rocky substrate means rideable conditions return quickly after rain.

## Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Free at Coldwater Trailhead (1661 Coldwater Rd). Directions from I-20: take Exit 179, north 2.1 miles, right onto Coldwater Pump Road, a few hundred yards, right onto paved road for 1 mile to parking. Alternate trailhead: Anniston Trailhead at 401 Monsanto St.
- **Fees**: Free (Alabama Forever Wild Land Trust public property)
- **February status**: Open 365 days/year — no seasonal closures
- **Hours**: Gate locks approximately 1 hour after sunset
- **Amenities**: No restrooms or running water at trailhead. Anniston (~10-15 min drive) has food, water, and restrooms.
