# Pigeon Mountain

> **Location**: Crockford-Pigeon Mountain Wildlife Management Area, LaFayette, GA

> **Nearby climbing**: [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (~10-15 min — same mountain!), [Zahnd Tract](../areas/zahnd-tract.md) (~10-20 min)

> [!WARNING]
> **WMA Access Restrictions**: All horse, bike, caving, hiking, and rock climbing trails are **CLOSED during firearm deer seasons**. Horse and bike trails are also **closed before 10:00 AM during archery deer and turkey season**. A Georgia Lands Pass ($19/year), hunting license, or fishing license is required for entry. **Verify Georgia DNR hunting season dates for February 2026 before planning.**

## Overview

Rugged, natural backcountry riding on ~12-15 miles of ungroomed singletrack through the WMA. Expect rocks, roots, creek crossings, steep grades, whoop-de-doos, gullies, and spectacular views along the West Brow. This is adventure riding for experienced riders — not machine-groomed flow trail. The only trail system directly adjacent to Rocktown, but WMA hunting season closures make it unreliable for a February trip without checking the Georgia DNR calendar first.

**Difficulty**: Blue (intermediate) through Black (advanced) — ~12.4-mile primary loop rated Moderate/Strenuous
