| **Delivery** | Free delivery/pickup in Coolidge Park area. Trailhead delivery available [UNVERIFIED: may have additional fee for locations outside downtown like ESNP] |
| **Cancellation** | Free up to 2 days before. No refund if cancelled day-of |
| **Sunday** | Available [UNVERIFIED] (delivery-based, not storefront-dependent) |

**Bike options** (pick one at booking):

| Bike | Wheels | Fork | Gears | Best For |
|------|--------|------|-------|----------|
| **Trek Roscoe** | 27.5+ | 120mm | 11-speed, dropper post | **Beginners** — stable, forgiving, modern geometry |
| Scott Aspect 950 | 29" | 100mm | 18-speed | Taller riders / XC preference |
| Polygon Xtrada | 27.5 | — | 2x10 | Budget alternative |

**What's included**: All Mountain MIPS bike helmet, keyless bike lock, spare tube.

**What's NOT included**: Water, snacks, shoes, gloves, riding clothing.

**How it works**: Book online → choose bike + delivery location → they deliver and size the bike to you → ride → lock the bike when done → call them → they pick it up.

> **Pick the Trek Roscoe** if you're a first-timer. The 27.5+ tires are wider and more stable, the dropper seat post gets the saddle out of the way on descents, and the 120mm fork smooths out bumps.

### Suck Creek Cycle

Chattanooga's premier local MTB shop. Primarily sales and service — **rental program is unverified**.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Address** | 630 W Bell Ave, Chattanooga, TN 37405 (North Shore) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~20-25 min |
| **Website** | [suckcreek.com](https://suckcreek.com/) |
| **Phone** | 423-266-8883 |
| **Email** | suckcreekcycle@gmail.com |
| **Hours** | Mon–Thu 10am–6pm, Fri 10am–5pm, Sat 8:30am–3pm |
| **Sunday** | **CLOSED** |
| **Rentals** | [UNVERIFIED — website does not list a rental program. Customer reviews mention renting bikes. **Call to confirm** availability, pricing, and bike types before the trip] |
| **Brands** | Yeti, Santa Cruz, Orbea, Ibis, Norco, Juliana |

**Why visit even if renting elsewhere**: Suck Creek is the #1 source for current trail conditions and local riding beta. Stop in on a weekday (Mon–Thu) before your first ride to ask about trail status, route suggestions, and any closures. They know every trail in the area.

### REI Chattanooga

National outdoor retailer with bike shop. Closest to lodging. Open Sundays.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Address** | 2507 Lifestyle Way, Chattanooga, TN 37421 (Hamilton Place) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~10-15 min |
| **Website** | [rei.com/stores/chattanooga](https://www.rei.com/stores/chattanooga/bike-shop) |
| **Phone** | 423-485-1249 (bike shop direct) |
| **Hours** | [UNVERIFIED — typical REI: Mon–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–7pm] |
| **Sunday** | Open (typical REI hours) |
| **Rentals** | [UNVERIFIED — REI rental programs vary by store. **Call 423-485-1249 to confirm** Chattanooga has mountain bike rentals before the trip] |
| **Pricing** | [UNVERIFIED — typical REI: ~$60-90/day for mountain bikes] |
| **Presidents' Day** | Feb 16 — may have holiday hours [UNVERIFIED] |

**Why consider**: Closest shop to lodging (~10-15 min). Open Sundays when Suck Creek is closed. Familiar brand with low anxiety for first-timers. REI rental bikes (where available) typically include helmet and basic kit.

**Limitations**: REI rental bikes tend to be basic hardtails — fine for a beginner but not the same experience as CGA's Trek Roscoe with dropper post. REI staff won't have the local trail knowledge that Suck Creek offers.

## Beginner-Friendly Trails

> You don't need to read the [full trail comparison table](README.md). These are the only trails a first-timer on a rental should consider.

### #1: Enterprise South — Black Forest

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Trail** | [Enterprise South](enterprise-south.md) — Black Forest loop |
| **Rating** | Green |
| **Distance** | ~3 miles |
| **Drive from lodging** | 0 min (you're already here) |
| **Estimated ride time** | 30–45 min at beginner pace |
| **Why it's great** | Smoothest singletrack in the area. Gentle rollers, wide turns, steady grades. No drops, no jumps, no technical features. Pump track at the trailhead for warming up before you hit the trail. |
| **Concerns** | Trails are directional depending on the day of the week — check signage at the trailhead. Park hours are ~7 AM to 5:30–6:30 PM in February. |

**The default choice.** If you only ride one trail the whole trip, make it Black Forest.

### #2: White Oak Mountain — Green Loop

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Trail** | [White Oak Mountain](white-oak-mountain.md) — Green Loop (Rolling Green, Hidden Spring, Valley, Dogwood segments) |
| **Rating** | Green |
| **Distance** | ~1.7 miles (ride it 2-3 times or explore the next loop up) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~15-25 min |
| **Estimated ride time** | 15–25 min per lap |
| **Why it's great** | Machine-built flow trails. Stacked loop system — the easiest trails are closest to the parking lot. Excellent drainage (best in the area — rideable sooner after rain). Open until 10 PM. Free. |
| **Concerns** | Short loop — may want multiple laps. Many intersections in the larger network, but blazes are clear. [UNVERIFIED: access policy — technically on Southern Adventist University land, but no fee has been reported.] |

**Best backup** if Enterprise South is closed or muddy.

### #3: Chickamauga Battlefield — Paved Road Tour (Fallback)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Trail** | [Chickamauga Battlefield](chickamauga-battlefield.md) — Historic Bike Tour Route |
| **Rating** | Easy (flat, paved) |
| **Distance** | ~12.6 miles (shortenable to any length) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~25-35 min |
| **Estimated ride time** | 1–2 hrs depending on distance |
| **Why it's here** | This is NOT mountain biking — it's flat paved road riding through a scenic Civil War battlefield. But if singletrack isn't your thing, this is a zero-risk fallback. ~70 interpretive pull-offs for rest stops. Rideable in any weather. Free (NPS). |
| **Concerns** | Not singletrack. Slow car traffic shares the road. 25-35 min drive from lodging. |

**Use this when**: Weather has closed all singletrack, or you tried Black Forest and decided dirt trails aren't for you.

### #4: Stringer's Ridge — Pump Track Only

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Trail** | [Stringer's Ridge](stringers-ridge.md) — Pump track at Spears Ave trailhead |
| **Rating** | Beginner-friendly (pump track only) |
| **Distance** | Small closed circuit |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~20-30 min |
| **Estimated ride time** | 15–20 min session |
| **Why it's here** | Great warm-up or skills session. Practice cornering, balance, and handling in a controlled environment with zero exposure risk. Restrooms and bike repair station at trailhead. |
| **Concerns** | The singletrack network beyond the pump track is Green-Blue mixed with no isolated beginner loop — frequent short, steep climbs and rooty sections. **Not recommended** beyond the pump track for a true beginner. |

**Best used as**: A 20-minute skills warm-up before heading to Enterprise South Black Forest.

### Skip These

These trails are NOT appropriate for a first-time rental rider:

| Trail | Why Not |
|-------|---------|
| Booker T. Washington | All Blue. Gnarly, rooty, steep climbs and fast descents. |
| Raccoon Mountain | Even "Green" trails are considered tough beginner. 30-40 min drive. |
| Walden's Ridge Park | Blue to Double Black gravity/DH trails. |
| Lookout Mountain | Blue to Black descent-oriented trails. |
| Five Points | Green–Black range but 45-55 min drive — too far for a first rental ride. |

## Climbing Day Pairings

> The group is climbing at ___. How do I rent and ride?

| Climbing Area | Rental Approach | Beginner Trail | Time Budget | Feasibility |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **[Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md)** | CGA delivery to Stringer's Ridge, or rent from Suck Creek (Mon–Sat, ~15-20 min from Stone Fort) | Stringer's pump track (~20 min) → [ESNP Black Forest](enterprise-south.md) (~3 mi) on the way home | ~3-4 hr half-day | Practical |
| **[Walden's Ridge](../areas/waldens-ridge.md)** | CGA delivery to ESNP, or pick up from Suck Creek | [ESNP Black Forest](enterprise-south.md) (~3 mi) — rider stays at lodging | ~2-3 hrs | Practical (simplest logistics) |
| **[Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) / [Zahnd](../areas/zahnd-tract.md)** | Not practical for beginner rental | N/A — nearest beginner trails are 40+ min from climbing area | — | Skip biking, or do an independent ESNP ride |
| **[HP40](../areas/hp40.md)** | Not practical | N/A — HP40 is ~2 hrs from lodging, no beginner trails nearby | — | Skip biking on HP40 days |

**Best pairing**: Walden's Ridge climbing day. The rider stays at lodging and rides ESNP while the group drives 25-35 min to climb. No coordination needed — everyone meets back at the house.

**Stone Fort pairing**: Rider gets dropped at Suck Creek or has CGA deliver to Stringer's Ridge (both near Stone Fort). Rides the pump track, then meets the group at ESNP on the way home.

## First-Timer Tips

### What to Wear

- **Athletic shorts or pants** — no jeans (chafing + restricted movement)
- **Moisture-wicking shirt** — no cotton (stays wet with sweat)
- **Closed-toe shoes with grippy soles** — trail runners or hiking shoes work great. No sandals, no flip-flops
- **Sunglasses** — trail debris protection
- **Light gloves** — recommended but not required (prevents blisters on longer rides)

### What's Included with Rental

With Chattanooga Guided Adventures ($89/24hr):
- Mountain bike (your choice of 3 models)
- All Mountain MIPS helmet
- Keyless bike lock
- Spare tube

### What to Bring

- **Water** — at least 1 bottle, ideally a hydration pack
- **Phone** — for emergency calls + trail maps
- **Snacks** — for rides over 1 hour
- **Sunscreen**

### Sizing

Rental companies size the bike to you at delivery/pickup based on your height. General reference:

| Height | Frame Size |
|--------|------------|
| 5'4"–5'8" | Small |
| 5'8"–6'0" | Medium |
| 6'0"–6'4" | Large |

CGA will handle sizing when they deliver. If renting from a shop, they'll fit you in-store.

### Trail Etiquette

- **Yield to hikers and horses** — bikes yield to everyone
- **Don't ride muddy trails** — if your tires leave ruts deeper than 1/2 inch, turn around. Ruts persist for years
- **Stay on marked trails** — no cutting switchbacks
- **Call out when passing** — "on your left" gives other users a heads-up
- **No skidding** — brake-sliding damages the trail surface

## February Considerations

### Presidents' Day Weekend (Feb 14–16)

The trip starts on Presidents' Day weekend. Rental inventory may be limited — **book at least 2 days ahead** through CGA. If renting from a shop, call early in the week to confirm availability.

### Sunday Closures

- **Suck Creek Cycle**: CLOSED Sundays — plan shop visits for Mon–Sat
- **CGA**: Available Sundays [UNVERIFIED] (delivery-based)
- **REI**: Typically open Sundays [UNVERIFIED — confirm hours]

### Winter Hours

Suck Creek closes earlier than you might expect:
- **Friday**: 10am–5pm (closes 1 hr early)
- **Saturday**: 8:30am–3pm (closes at 3!)
- **Mon–Thu**: 10am–6pm (standard)

### Wet Weather

If it rains, check [SORBA Chattanooga](https://www.sorbachattanooga.org/) for trail status before riding. Quick-drying options for rental riders:

| Trail | Drainage | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| [White Oak Mountain](white-oak-mountain.md) | Excellent — best in the area | Go-to after rain. See [Beginner trail #2](#2-white-oak-mountain--green-loop). |
| [Enterprise South](enterprise-south.md) | Good — rock-lined trails drain quickly | Some muddy spots in drainages. See [Beginner trail #1](#1-enterprise-south--black-forest). |
| [Chickamauga Battlefield](chickamauga-battlefield.md) | Always rideable | Paved roads — weather doesn't matter. See [Fallback trail #3](#3-chickamauga-battlefield--paved-road-tour-fallback). |

### Freeze/Thaw

February mornings can be frozen. Frozen trails are OK to ride. But when temps rise mid-morning, frozen trails become a sloppy mess. **Ride early (frozen) or wait for full thaw and dry-out.** Riding during thaw creates deep ruts that persist for years.
