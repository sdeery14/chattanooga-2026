# Stringer's Ridge

> **Location**: North Chattanooga (2 miles from downtown)
> **Drive from lodging**: ~20-30 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area
> **Nearby climbing**: [Walden's Ridge](../areas/waldens-ridge.md) (~15-20 min), [Stone Fort](../areas/stone-fort.md) (~30-40 min)

## Overview

A 92-acre urban wilderness park with ~7 miles of well-groomed singletrack (up to ~10 miles including spurs, some of which are foot-traffic only). Best suited as a quick session, warm-up ride, or hotel ride rather than an all-day destination. Scenic views of downtown Chattanooga, the Tennessee River, and Lookout Mountain.

## Trails & Difficulty

Green (beginner) through Blue (intermediate). Rolling hills with frequent short, steep climbs. Mix of smoother singletrack, rooty sections, and moderately technical features. A pump track is located at the north end (Spears Avenue trailhead).

Expect 1-2 hours of riding to cover the full network.

## Conditions

- **Drainage**: Moderate. No "drains well" claims -- the park has experienced mudslide-related closures in the past. Avoid after heavy rain.
- **Freeze/thaw**: Moderate concern, though the urban location may warm faster than mountaintop trails.
- **February outlook**: Generally rideable in dry conditions. Check for closure notices if recent rain has been heavy.

## Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: North end trailhead on Spears Avenue (ample parking, restrooms, bike repair station). Cherokee Boulevard trailhead also available.
- **Fees**: Free (city park)
- **February status**: Open year-round.
- **Hours**: Dawn to dusk
