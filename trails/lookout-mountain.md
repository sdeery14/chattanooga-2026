# Lookout Mountain — Moonshine / CCT

> **Location**: Lookout Mountain, GA (atop Lookout Mountain near Covenant College)
> **Drive from lodging**: ~40-50 min from Enterprise South Nature Park area
> **Nearby climbing**: [Rocktown](../areas/rocktown.md) (~30-45 min), [Zahnd Tract](../areas/zahnd-tract.md) (~30-45 min)

## Overview

Descent-oriented riding with ~8 miles of technical singletrack split between the Chattanooga Connector Trail (flowing intermediate descent) and the Moonshine Trails (raw, natural, advanced riding with rock bridges, boulders, and creek crossings). The Moonshine trails are the highlight — White Lightning, Firewater, and Bathtub Gin offer fast descents, tight switchbacks, and rock gardens. Pairs well with Five Points for a full Lookout Mountain riding day.

**Difficulty**: Blue (intermediate) through Black (advanced)
