# Vision: Chattanooga Climbing Trip Knowledge Base

## Purpose

This repository exists to **centralize preparation, research, and decision support** for a Chattanooga-area climbing trip, so that in-the-moment choices can be made **quickly, confidently, and with minimal friction**.

Instead of scrambling on phones, juggling guidebooks, or re-researching the same information under time pressure, this repo serves as a **single source of truth** that can be referenced before and during the trip.

The goal is not to rigidly plan each day, but to **enable good decisions under uncertainty**.

---

## Guiding Philosophy

- **Preparation over planning**
  This repo favors curated options and context over fixed schedules.

- **Optionality is a feature**
  Every section should preserve flexibility for weather, conditions, energy levels, group dynamics, and rest needs.

- **Low-friction access**
  Information should be easy to skim, searchable, and usable offline when possible.

- **Mixed-ability aware**
  The repo explicitly supports climbers of different strength levels and body types without optimizing exclusively for any single group.

---

## Trip Constraints & Assumptions

These constraints define the scope of research and planning throughout the repository.

### Climbing Style

- **100% bouldering**
- No sport climbing
- No trad climbing
- All climbing research assumes **pad-based access only**

---

### Ability Levels Represented

The group includes climbers across three broad performance bands:

- **V0–V1 climbers**
- **~V5 climbers**
- **~V10 climbers**

Planning and research should reflect that:

- **V10 climbers are the primary psych and focus of the trip**
- Area selection should prioritize zones with **high-quality hard bouldering**
- Lower-grade options should be identified **when they exist nearby**, but not at the expense of the primary objectives
- It is acceptable—and sometimes expected—for days or sessions to be **lopsided toward harder climbing**, provided this is an intentional choice

The goal is _awareness_, not forced balance.

---

### Coexistence & Group Support

The group is **supportive and flexible**. Planning assumptions should reflect that:

- It is acceptable to visit areas that primarily serve **one climber or subset of the group**
- Lower-grade climbers may occasionally climb less or switch activities (e.g., hiking, biking, spotting)
- The repo should **not enforce artificial parity** between ability levels

However:

- The trip should avoid being _entirely_ dominated by isolated objectives for a single climber across all days
- When feasible, the repo should surface:
  - Nearby warm-ups or moderates
  - Short-walk alternatives
  - Parallel activities (especially mountain biking)

This preserves morale without diluting intent.

---

### Body Type Considerations

- The group includes **varied body types**
- Notes should call out when problems or areas are:
  - Reachy or span-friendly
  - Compression-heavy vs technical

- These notes are informational, not constraints

---

### Non-Climbing Activities

- One participant (V0 climber) will bring a **mountain bike**
- The repository should treat mountain biking as a **first-class consideration**, not an afterthought
- Research should include:
  - Bike-friendly rest days
  - Half-day ride options paired with climbing
  - Parallel climbing + biking days

---

## What Success Looks Like

This repo is successful if, during the trip:

- A climbing area is chosen and **everyone quickly understands the tradeoffs**
- High-end climbers have **clear primary objectives**
- Other climbers have **nearby or parallel options**
- Rest or low-energy days have **pre-vetted alternatives**
- Decisions feel **intentional rather than reactive**

The repo should reduce cognitive load, not add it.

---

## Scope

### In Scope

- Bouldering areas and sub-areas
- Curated problem suggestions by zone and grade band
- Notes on style, conditions, and proximity
- Mountain biking routes and trail systems
- Rest day and split-activity options
- Lightweight logistics notes (driving, access, timing)
- Personal notes and reminders

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- Sport or trad climbing research
- Fixed daily itineraries
- Exhaustive tick lists
- Grade-maximization goals
- Detailed beta documentation

This is a **decision-support system**, not a performance plan.

---

## Intended Use

1. **Before the trip**
   - Gather and organize research
   - Identify primary and fallback zones
   - Build familiarity with the area

2. **During the trip**
   - Rapidly answer:
     - “Where should we go today?”
     - “What can I climb here?”
     - “What else can I do nearby?”

   - Minimize phone-based research

3. **After the trip (optional)**
   - Capture quick reflections
   - Improve future trip templates

---

## Design Principles for All Future Docs

All future documents should be:

- Skimmable
- Context-aware
- Decision-oriented
- Useful when tired, hungry, or short on time

If a document wouldn’t help in those conditions, it doesn’t belong.

## Feature Roadmap

Features are additive, not blocking. Each improves decision quality
without controlling behavior, and remains useful even if plans change
mid-trip. This roadmap favors **early usability** over completeness.

### Feature 001: Primary Bouldering Areas (Hard-First, Group-Aware)

Identify and contextualize the core bouldering areas most likely to
be visited, prioritizing V8–V10 quality while remaining group-aware.

- Area overviews (Stone Fort, Rocktown, etc.)
- Why hard climbers care about each area
- Density of nearby moderates (if any)
- Notes on access, vibes, and conditions
- Does NOT include individual problem lists or daily plans

This feature is the **foundation** of the repo.

### Feature 002: Area-Scoped Problem Clusters (V0–V3 / V4–V6 / V8–V10)

Quick, area-based "what can I climb here?" answers without becoming
a tick list.

- Small curated lists per area
- Emphasis on proximity (same bloc / short walk)
- Body-type notes where relevant
- "Good if conditions suck" flags
- NOT full Mountain Project mirrors or detailed beta

### Feature 003: Parallel Activity Mapping (Mountain Biking + Climbing)

Make mountain biking a seamless, intentional parallel activity rather
than a fallback.

- Trail systems near major climbing zones
- Ride length / intensity notes
- How biking pairs with climbing days
- Logistics (trailheads, drive time)

### Feature 004: Rest Day & Low-Energy Decision Pack

Eliminate rest-day indecision and last-minute phone spirals.

- Active rest (short hikes, easy rides)
- True rest (food, breweries, town walks)
- Weather-dependent alternatives

### Feature 005: Conditions, Timing & Reality Notes

Capture Chattanooga-specific "things you only learn by being there."

- Conditions by area (sun, humidity, wind)
- Crowds and weekend dynamics
- Skin management realities
- Seasonal notes

### Feature 006: Logistics & Access Cheat Sheets

Reduce friction around moving between places.

- Parking notes
- Approach reminders
- Drive-time comparisons
- "Don't screw this up" access notes

### Feature 007: Personal Trip Goals & Preferences (Sean)

A deeply personal reference for Sean — the group's V0–V1 outdoor
climber and the only mountain biker. Covers climbing growth targets
that play to his athletic strengths (6'2", 200lbs, explosive power,
long reach), mountain biking skill-development goals, IPA-forward
brewery targets, food spots, and sightseeing. Not a group document;
a personal decision-support layer on top of group research.

- Climbing: "project" problems in the V2–V4 range that suit reach and power
- Mountain biking: flow/XC rides plus trail/enduro skill development
- Breweries (IPA focus), restaurants, and food spots to hit
- Sights, experiences, or side-trips of personal interest
- Personal packing and bike transport logistics
- "If I only have one day left" priority stack

### Feature 008: Personal Notes & Trip Annotations (Optional)

Capture lightweight reflections without turning the repo into a diary.

- What worked / didn't
- Areas to revisit or skip next time
- Template improvements

### Feature Dependency Map

```
Vision
  ↓
001 Areas → 002 Problems → 003 Biking → 004 Rest Days
  ↓
005 Conditions → 006 Logistics → 007 Personal Goals → 008 Reflections
```

You can stop at any point and still have a valuable repo.

### Recommended Execution Order

If time is tight:

1. **Feature 001** – must have
2. **Feature 002** – huge value
3. **Feature 003** – personal win
4. **Feature 004** – sanity saver
5. **Feature 007** – personal psych fuel

Everything else is bonus.

## Long-Term View

This repository may later evolve into:

- A reusable **trip-planning template**
- A personal **outdoor decision notebook**
- An experiment in applying Spec-Kit beyond software

These are optional futures, not requirements.
