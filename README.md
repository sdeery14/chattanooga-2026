## What's in the Repo

### [Bouldering Areas](areas/README.md)

Area profiles for 10 climbing destinations sorted by quality for hard climbing. Each area has an overview (style, conditions, access) and a curated problem list organized by grade band (V0-V3 / V4-V6 / V7-V10). Comparison table and quick decision filters included.

**Tier 1** (trip anchors): Stone Fort, Rocktown, HP40
**Tier 2** (supplementary): Dayton Pocket, Zahnd Tract, Dogwood, Hospital Boulders, Walden's Ridge

### [Conditions, Timing & Reality Notes](conditions/README.md)

"Given today's weather, which area?" Six weather scenarios mapped to area recommendations. Includes a sandstone friction primer, per-area conditions synthesis, crowd/timing profiles, skin management guide, and February seasonal data.

### [Logistics & Access Cheat Sheets](logistics/README.md)

"How do we get there and what do we need to know?" Drive-time comparison table (sorted nearest to farthest), per-area access cheat sheets (fees, gates, registration, parking, approach), 12 critical warnings ("Don't Screw This Up"), and 4 multi-area day pairings.

### [Mountain Biking Trails](trails/README.md)

12 trail systems near Chattanooga with February conditions, difficulty ratings, and climbing-area pairings. Includes wet-weather fallbacks and a comparison table.

### [Rest Days & Low-Energy Options](rest-days/README.md)

24 options across four energy tiers (zero, low, active, day trip). Breweries, restaurants, hikes, museums, and more — all with drive times, costs, and rain-OK flags.

## Before the Trip

1. Read the [Don't Screw This Up](logistics/README.md#dont-screw-this-up) section — 7 pre-trip action items (gate codes, registrations, licenses)
2. Skim the [drive-time table](logistics/README.md#drive-time-comparison) to build a mental map
3. Browse [area profiles](areas/README.md) to get familiar with the options
4. Check the [conditions guide](conditions/README.md) to understand weather-to-area logic

## During the Trip

1. Check the weather each morning (temperature, dew point, wind, rain)
2. Open the [conditions quick reference](conditions/README.md#conditions-quick-reference) to pick the best area
3. Check that area's [access cheat sheet](logistics/README.md#area-access-cheat-sheets) for fees, gates, and rules
4. Check the [problem clusters](areas/README.md) for what to climb when you arrive

## The Group

- **V10 climbers** — primary trip focus; area selection prioritizes hard-climbing quality
- **~V5 climbers** — strong moderate options at most areas
- **V0-V1 climbers** — nearby easy problems identified; may split for biking or rest-day activities

## Key Warnings

- **HP40 is Central Time** — gate closes 6 PM CT (= 7 PM ET). Be at your car by 5:30 PM CT.
- **Dayton Pocket locks at 7 PM ET** — you WILL be locked in if you're late.
- **Rocktown road** — last 3 mi unpaved; don't attempt after rain.
- **Hospital Boulders** — need gate code from SCC in advance.
- **Georgia WMA license** — required for Rocktown and Zahnd; buy at gooutdoorsgeorgia.com before you go.
