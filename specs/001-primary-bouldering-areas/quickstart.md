# Quickstart: Using the Area Profiles

## Before the Trip

1. Open `areas/README.md` for the comparison table
2. Scan the V7–V10 column to identify primary destinations
3. Click through to individual profiles for detail

## During the Trip

**"Where should we go today?"**
→ Open `areas/README.md`, filter mentally by:
  - Today's conditions (check Feb Conditions column)
  - How far you want to drive (check Drive column)
  - Who needs climbing (check grade density columns)

**"What's this area like?"**
→ Open the specific area file (e.g., `areas/stone-fort.md`)
→ Sections are in fixed order: Overview → Hard Appeal → Grade
  Density → Conditions → Logistics → Access → Style → Sources

**"Will I have anything to climb here?"**
→ Check the Grade Density section for your band:
  - V0–V3 (easy) / V4–V6 (moderate) / V7–V10 (hard)
  - Descriptors: abundant / strong / moderate / limited / nearly nonexistent
