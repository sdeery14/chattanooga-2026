# Research: Primary Bouldering Areas

**Phase 0 output for Feature 001** | **Date**: 2026-02-08
**Trip dates**: February 14–21, 2026
**Reference point**: Enterprise South Nature Park area

## Area Inventory

Research identified 15+ potential areas within ~2 hours. After filtering
for bouldering-only scope (constitution Principle II), the following
areas qualify for profiles:

### Tier 1: Primary V7–V10 Destinations

| Area | Drive | V7–V10 Depth | Why It Matters |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|
| Horse Pens 40 (HP40) | ~2 hrs | Outstanding (60+ at V8+) | World-class compression/slopers; stiff grades; peak Feb conditions |
| Rocktown | ~50–70 min | Excellent | Diverse hard classics; Golden Harvest V10; coarse sandstone |
| Stone Fort (LRC) | ~35–45 min | Strong | Most versatile area; deepest warmup pool; slightly softer grades |

### Tier 2: Supplementary Areas

| Area | Drive | V7–V10 Depth | Best Used As |
|------|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Dayton Pocket | ~50–65 min | Moderate (Vapor Roof focus) | Half-day roof session; pair with another area |
| Zahnd Tract | ~50–60 min | Limited | Addon to a Rocktown day (15 min apart); solitude |
| Dogwood | ~45–55 min | Limited (V3–V7 sweet spot) | Moderate-focused session; developing area |
| Hospital Boulders | ~1.5–2 hrs | Limited [UNVERIFIED] | Easy-access moderate climbing near HP40 corridor |
| Walden's Ridge Park | ~25–35 min | Minimal | Quick local session; no driving commitment |

### Tier 3: Included for Completeness (Not Bouldering Destinations)

| Area | Reason for Low Ranking |
|------|----------------------|
| Sunset Park / Sunset Rock | Primarily trad climbing; minimal documented bouldering |
| Hell's Kitchen | Promising but 2-mile approach; thin public info; developing |

### Removed from Scope

| Area | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Denny Cove | Rope climbing only (sport/trad) — violates Principle II |
| Cherokee Rock Village / Sand Rock | Rope climbing area — violates Principle II |
| Little Rock City (Montague) | Cannot confirm as separate from Stone Fort [UNVERIFIED] |
| Pendergrass | Cannot confirm exists in Chattanooga region [UNVERIFIED] |
| Prentice Cooper, North Chickamauga, etc. | Minor local areas; not destinations for visiting group |

## Key Research Decisions

### Decision 1: Which areas get full profiles?

- **Decision**: 8 full profiles (HP40, Rocktown, Stone Fort, Dayton Pocket,
  Zahnd, Dogwood, Hospital Boulders, Walden's Ridge) + 2 brief profiles
  (Sunset Rock, Hell's Kitchen)
- **Rationale**: Tier 1 and Tier 2 areas all offer bouldering and could
  realistically be visited. Tier 3 areas get abbreviated profiles noting
  why they're not primary options. This satisfies FR-010 (comprehensive
  survey) without inflating marginal areas.
- **Alternatives considered**: Full profiles for all 10+ areas (rejected:
  dilutes signal); only Tier 1 (rejected: misses the "lay of the land"
  goal)

### Decision 2: Profile depth calibration

- **Decision**: Consistent structured template across all profiles. Tier 1
  areas may have slightly more detail under "Hard Appeal" but all sections
  are present for every area.
- **Rationale**: Uniform structure per FR-011 and clarification session.
  Keeps profiles scannable and comparison reference easy to generate.
- **Alternatives considered**: Variable depth by tier (rejected: creates
  inconsistent reading experience)

### Decision 3: How to handle unverified information

- **Decision**: Include all areas with available information. Flag specific
  claims as [UNVERIFIED] inline. Cite sources for every factual claim.
- **Rationale**: Per constitution Principle V and FR-008. Better to include
  with caveats than to omit potentially useful areas.
- **Alternatives considered**: Omit areas with thin info (rejected: misses
  the comprehensive survey goal)

### Decision 4: February conditions framing

- **Decision**: All conditions notes are framed for mid-February (trip
  window). General seasonal info is included but February-specific
  conditions are highlighted.
- **Rationale**: Trip dates are fixed. Conditions data is most useful when
  contextualized to the actual visit window.
- **Alternatives considered**: Generic year-round conditions (rejected:
  less actionable for this trip)

### Decision 5: Comparison reference format

- **Decision**: `areas/README.md` serves as both the area index and the
  comparison table. Single Markdown table with key dimensions per FR-009.
- **Rationale**: One file to open for quick comparison. No separate
  "comparison.md" needed — keeps file count low.
- **Alternatives considered**: Separate comparison document (rejected:
  adds a file with redundant content)

## Unverified Items Requiring Local Confirmation

1. Stone Fort / Mowbray Mountain exact elevation (~1,800–2,000 ft est.)
2. Hospital Boulders exact V7–V10 problem count and drive time
3. Walden's Ridge specific hard problem grades
4. Hell's Kitchen grade distribution and current development status
5. Dayton Pocket shade/sun patterns and V0–V3 density
6. Rocktown February 2026 hunting closure dates (archery ends Jan 1;
   likely fully open, but verify GA WMA schedule)
