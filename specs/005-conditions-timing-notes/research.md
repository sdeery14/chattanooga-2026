## 1. February Weather & Seasonal Conditions

### Temperature

Chattanooga's February climate sits firmly in the ideal bouldering window. Average daily
highs range from 51-59F, increasing through the month. Average lows are around 35F.
This 35-59F daily range is nearly optimal for sandstone friction, which peaks when
rock surface temperature is in the 32-50F band.

| Average high | 51-59F (increasing through Feb) | [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/15110/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States) |
| Average low | ~35F | [climate-data.org](https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/tennessee/chattanooga-1577/t/february-2/) |
| Record lows | Can drop to single digits on cold fronts | [NWS Chattanooga](https://www.weather.gov/mrx/chaclimate) |
| Overcast frequency | ~52% of days overcast or mostly cloudy | [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/15110/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States) |

**For the group**: Mornings will often be in the 30s-low 40s. Afternoons will warm into
the 50s. This daily swing matters: friction is best in the morning cold, but fingers may
be too numb to try hard below ~35F. The sweet spot is typically mid-morning through early
afternoon (roughly 10am-2pm) when temps are 40-55F.

### Precipitation

February is one of Chattanooga's wetter months. Rain is a real planning concern.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average precipitation | ~4.1 inches total | [weather-atlas.com](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/tennessee-usa/chattanooga-weather-february) |
| Rain days | ~13-14 days with measurable rain | [weather-atlas.com](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/tennessee-usa/chattanooga-weather-february) |
| Snowfall | ~1.85 inches possible (Feb is peak snow month) | [weather-atlas.com](https://www.weather-atlas.com/en/tennessee-usa/chattanooga-weather-february) |
| Annual total rainfall | ~55 inches | [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/places/best-bouldering-climbing-chattanooga-tennessee/) |

**Decision impact**: With rain roughly every other day on average, the group should expect
at least 2-3 rain events during the 7-day trip. Sandstone needs 24-48 hours minimum to
dry after rain (longer in winter when sun angles are low and air is cooler). This makes
rain-response planning critical: have a backup plan for every day, know which areas
dry fastest, and know which areas have sheltered climbing.

### Humidity & Dew Point

Dew point is more important than relative humidity for predicting friction. February
dew points in Chattanooga are among the year's lowest.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average relative humidity | 66-78% (varies by source/time of day) | [weather-and-climate.com](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Humidity-perc,chattanooga-tennessee-us,United-States-of-America); [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/chattanooga/climate) |
| Average dew point | 31-33F | [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/15110/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States); [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/chattanooga/climate) |
| Humidity daily pattern | Highest in early morning (70-85%+), lowest in mid-afternoon (50-65%) | [UNVERIFIED] — general SE US pattern; specific Chattanooga hourly data not confirmed |

**Why this matters for climbing**: A dew point of 31-33F is excellent for friction. Compare
this to the "greasy" threshold of 55-60F+ dew points typical in summer. February's dew
points mean the air holds very little moisture, which keeps rock surfaces dry and chalk
effective. Relative humidity can be high in the morning (fog, dew) but the absolute
moisture content is low because the air is cold.

**The morning humidity trap**: Relative humidity often spikes above 80% before sunrise and
in early morning. This can cause condensation on rock surfaces even without rain. However,
because the dew point is low (30s), the rock warms above dew point quickly once sun hits
it. East-facing boulders will clear condensation first; north-facing and shaded boulders
may stay damp longer.

### Sunrise & Sunset

Daylight governs the practical climbing window, especially at areas with gate closures.

| Date | Sunrise | Sunset | Day Length |
|------|---------|--------|------------|
| Feb 14 | ~7:20 AM | ~6:29 PM | ~11h 9min |
| Feb 17 | ~7:17 AM | ~6:32 PM | ~11h 15min |
| Feb 21 | ~7:13 AM | ~6:36 PM | ~11h 23min |

Source: [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/usa/chattanooga)

**Practical climbing window**: ~8:00 AM to ~5:30 PM (allowing for travel and warmup). At
areas with gate closures (Dayton Pocket locks at 7 PM, HP40 gate closes at 6 PM CT),
plan to leave well before sunset. February days are short enough that last-light
sends are not realistic at gated areas.

### Wind

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average wind speed | 9-11 mph | [Weather Spark](https://weatherspark.com/m/15110/2/Average-Weather-in-February-in-Chattanooga-Tennessee-United-States) |
| Prevailing direction | Variable; channeled by the Tennessee Valley topography | [UNVERIFIED] — specific prevailing direction for February not confirmed in sources |

**For climbers**: 9-11 mph average wind is moderate. On ridge-top areas like Rocktown
(Pigeon Mountain) and HP40 (Chandler Mountain), wind exposure is greater and can make
cold days feel much colder. Valley-floor areas like Stone Fort are more sheltered.
Wind is generally a positive for friction (dries rock, cools fingers) but a negative
for comfort in February.

### Comparison to Ideal Bouldering Conditions

February in Chattanooga is **peak bouldering season** for sandstone. The combination
of low dew points (30s), moderate temps (40-55F daytime), and short days with low
sun angles creates conditions that sandstone climbers travel from across the country
to experience. The main risk factors are rain frequency and morning condensation --
not heat or humidity.

| Factor | February Rating | Ideal Climbing | Notes |
|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Temperature | Excellent | 32-50F rock temp | Daily highs 51-59F; mornings in sweet spot |
| Dew point | Excellent | Below 40F | Average 31-33F; well below "greasy" threshold |
| Precipitation | Poor | None | ~14 rain days per month; biggest trip risk |
| Wind | Good | Light-moderate | Helps friction; can be cold on ridgetops |
| Daylight | Adequate | N/A | ~11 hours; short but sufficient |

## 2. Area-Specific Conditions

### Stone Fort (LRC)

**Elevation**: ~1,800 ft (atop Mowbray Mountain) [UNVERIFIED — approximate based on
Mowbray Mountain elevation]

**Rock type**: Bullet-hard Cumberland Plateau sandstone (grey and orange). Fine-grained,
extremely durable. This is "hard" sandstone as opposed to soft desert sandstone -- it does
not break easily when wet, but still absorbs moisture that degrades friction.

**Humidity sensitivity**: Moderate. The fine-grained bullet sandstone at Stone Fort holds
friction better than coarser sandstones in moderate humidity. However, slopers become
noticeably harder above ~55-60% relative humidity. Crimps and edges remain usable at
higher humidity levels. The area has both slabby and steep problems; slab-dependent
problems are most humidity-sensitive because they rely on shoe rubber friction against
flat surfaces.

**Sun/shade patterns**: Stone Fort is on a broad, forested mountaintop. The boulder field
includes both exposed and sheltered sectors:

- **Main Area**: Open, sunny, dries fast after rain. South-facing aspects get direct
  sun by late morning. This is the go-to sector after rain or on humid mornings — the
  sun and air circulation help the rock dry and warm above dew point quickly.
  Source: [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/121960065/main-area)

- **Deep Woods / Corridors**: Shaded by forest canopy and the "deep and narrow corridors"
  of house-sized blocks that define Stone Fort's character. These areas stay damp longer
  after rain (12-24 hours vs. 2-4 hours for sunny sectors). They also stay cooler,
  which is ideal on warm February afternoons but problematic for drying.
  Source: [57hours](https://57hours.com/best-of/chattanooga-climbing/); [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/places/best-bouldering-climbing-chattanooga-tennessee/)

**Wind exposure**: Mostly sheltered. The forest canopy and boulder corridors block wind
effectively. On the ridgetop there is some exposure, but far less than Rocktown or HP40.

**Seepage after rain**: Sandstone retains moisture. Plan for:
- Light rain (< 1 hour): Sunny boulders may dry in 2-4 hours. Overhanging problems
  under roofs may remain dry throughout.
- Moderate rain: 24 hours minimum. Deep woods sectors may need 36-48 hours.
- Heavy or prolonged rain: 48-72+ hours for shaded sectors. In winter with low sun
  angles, drying is slower than in other seasons.

**Tip for rain days**: Look for roof-capped and overhanging problems like Midway (V7) and
Super Mario (V4) which stay dry under overhangs even during rain. Stone Fort has been
described as "climbable even after spouts of rain" due to these sheltered features.
Source: [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/places/best-bouldering-climbing-chattanooga-tennessee/)

**Best time of day**: Mid-morning through early afternoon (10am-2pm). Early morning
condensation clears as sun warms the Main Area. Afternoon temperatures rarely get too
warm in February to degrade friction.

**Worst conditions**: Sustained multi-day rain followed by overcast skies with no wind.
The forested setting traps moisture and prevents drying. Also avoid climbing on visibly
wet or dark-colored (damp) sandstone — it damages the rock.

### Rocktown

**Elevation**: ~2,200-2,330 ft (top of Pigeon Mountain ridge).
Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_Mountain_(Georgia)); [PeakVisor](https://peakvisor.com/peak/pigeon-mountain-11ly7maqk.html)

**Rock type**: Coarse-grained sandstone. Noticeably rougher texture than Stone Fort's
bullet sandstone. Features include huecos, chicken heads (rounded protrusions), bomber
slopers, crimps, and rails. The coarser grain provides excellent friction but is more
abrasive on skin.

**Humidity sensitivity**: Moderate-high. Like all sandstone, friction degrades with
humidity. However, Rocktown's elevation advantage means it is often cooler and drier
than the Chattanooga valley floor. Temperature at the summit can be 5-10F cooler
than Chattanooga proper [UNVERIFIED — estimated from ~1,500 ft elevation gain at
standard lapse rate]. This can work both ways: better friction from lower dew point,
or more condensation/ice on very cold mornings.

**Sun/shade patterns**: The boulder field sits along the ridgetop in a mostly open,
forest-mixed setting. Boulders face multiple directions — there is no single dominant
aspect. Some boulders get full sun; others are forest-shaded. The ridgetop location
means more sky exposure and generally better drying than forest-floor areas.

**Wind exposure**: High. Ridgetop location on Pigeon Mountain is significantly more
wind-exposed than valley-floor areas. In February, this means:
- Positive: Rock dries faster, friction stays better, less condensation
- Negative: Wind chill can be brutal. A 40F day with 15 mph wind feels like 32F. Bring
  layers and consider puffer jackets between attempts.

**Seepage after rain**: The standard 24-48 hour rule applies. Coarse sandstone absorbs
water deeply. The guidebook and community consensus is clear: "Climbers must wait 24-48
hours for the rock to dry completely after rain. Do not ever climb on wet rock."
Source: [KAYA Climb Rocktown Guide](https://blog.kayaclimb.com/rocktown-bouldering-guide-how-when-and-where/)

**Drying advantage**: The ridgetop position, wind exposure, and mixed sun/shade mean
Rocktown can dry somewhat faster than the deep woods sectors at Stone Fort. However,
it is still sandstone and still needs at least 24 hours after any real rain.

**Best time of day**: Late morning through mid-afternoon (11am-3pm). Allow time for morning
condensation/dew to clear. The approach takes 15-20 minutes from the parking area, which
provides a natural warmup window.

**Worst conditions**: Heavy rain within 24 hours, or sustained fog/cloud cover at ridgetop
elevation (Rocktown can be socked in when the valley is clear). Also: very cold and
windy days where wind chill makes climbing uncomfortable (below ~25F wind chill).

**Access note**: The trails at Rocktown are closed until 10 AM from September through
January 1st for archery season. This restriction should NOT apply during the Feb 14-21
trip window. Confirm before the trip.

### HP40 (Horse Pens 40)

**Elevation**: ~1,480-1,500 ft (atop Chandler Mountain).
Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_Pens_40); [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/alabama/horse-pens-40-loop)

**Rock type**: Fine-grained, smooth sandstone. This is the defining characteristic of HP40.
The rock is "smooth yet surprisingly grippy in cold conditions" — almost polished in
texture compared to coarser areas. HP40 is the sloper capital of the Southeast; the
smooth, rounded features demand body tension, compression, and precise body positioning
rather than pull-on-hold strength.
Source: [KAYA Climb HP40 Guide](https://blog.kayaclimb.com/horse-pens-40-bouldering-guide-how-when-and-where/); [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/horse-pens-40/)

**Humidity sensitivity**: Very high — the highest of the three Tier 1 areas. HP40's
sloper-heavy style makes it the most friction-dependent area. When humidity rises:
- Slopers that are bomber at 40% humidity become impossible at 65%+
- The smooth rock provides very little "mechanical" friction (no crystal edges to grip);
  it relies on surface adhesion between skin/rubber and rock
- Dew point is the critical metric: below 40F dew point = excellent; 40-50F = good;
  above 50F = slopers start to feel greasy; above 60F = avoid HP40 entirely

**The friction threshold**: Fall, winter, and early spring are when HP40's slopers are
"stickiest." The prime season is late October to early April. February is deep in
this window and should offer excellent conditions -- but only on dry days.
Source: [KAYA Climb](https://blog.kayaclimb.com/horse-pens-40-bouldering-guide-how-when-and-where/)

**Sun/shade patterns**: HP40 sits on a mountaintop with open and forested areas. Some
bouldering sectors are in clearings with good sun exposure; others are under tree cover.
The park includes "Shelter Boulders" which provide natural wind protection. Campsite areas
along cliff edges are wind-exposed.
Source: [Mountain Project](https://www.mountainproject.com/area/106094862/horse-pens-40)

**Wind exposure**: Moderate-high. Mountaintop location on Chandler Mountain provides
elevation-driven wind exposure, particularly along cliff edges and in open areas. Sheltered
sectors in the trees and between boulders are less exposed.

**Seepage after rain**: Standard sandstone drying rules apply (24-48 hours). HP40's smooth
rock can show water marks (darker patches) more visibly than coarser sandstone. If the rock
looks darker in patches, it is still wet — do not climb. The "if the ground is wet, the
rock is wet" rule of thumb applies.
Source: [Mountain Project forums](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/112569161/how-long-to-wait-to-climb-on-sandstone-after-rain)

**Best time of day**: Mid-morning through early afternoon in February. Wait for overnight
dew/frost to clear. On cold February mornings, the smooth rock can be ice-cold and
numb fingers before you even touch a hold — warm hands between attempts and consider
hand warmers.

**Worst conditions**: Humidity above 55-60%, recent rain, or warm afternoons (above 60F).
Also: HP40 is 2 hours from ESNP, so a wasted day here due to bad conditions is costly.
Check weather carefully before committing to the drive.

**Decision heuristic for HP40**: Check the dew point forecast. If the dew point will be
above 45F for most of the day, HP40 slopers will be compromised. Consider Stone Fort
(more crimp/edge options) or Rocktown (coarser texture helps) instead. If the dew point
is in the 20s-30s: HP40 will be magic. This is the day to send sloper projects.

### Other Areas (Tier 2 Conditions Notes)

#### Dayton Pocket

**Conditions profile**: Sheltered gorge setting along a river. The roof-heavy climbing
(Vapor Roof is the signature feature) means many problems are naturally sheltered from
rain. However, the gorge setting can trap humidity and stay damp. After rain, the gorge
itself may be muddy and the approach trail wet.
[UNVERIFIED — gorge humidity trapping is inferred from terrain; not confirmed by
area-specific source]

**Unique advantage**: On a day when open-face boulders are still drying from recent rain,
Dayton Pocket's overhanging roof problems may be climbable. This makes it a potentially
useful rain-backup area, though the 50-65 minute drive must be weighed.

**Gate hours**: Open 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM. The caretaker locks the gate at 7 PM -- if you
are still inside, you will be locked in. Plan to exit by 6:30 PM at the latest. Online
climbing registration is required through the Tennessee State Parks system.

#### Walden's Ridge Park

**Conditions profile**: Close to ESNP (~25-35 min), on the eastern slope of Signal Mountain.
Forested setting on Pennsylvanian sandstone. The proximity makes it viable for short
sessions when conditions elsewhere are questionable or when the group wants a quick
session without committing to a long drive.
Source: [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/waldens-ridge/); [Outdoor Chattanooga](https://outdoorchattanooga.com/waldens-ridge/)

**Drying**: Forest-covered setting likely means slower drying than exposed ridgetop areas.
[UNVERIFIED — no area-specific drying data found]

#### Hospital Boulders

**Conditions profile**: Located near Gadsden, Alabama (~1.5-2 hrs from ESNP). On the west
brow of Lookout Mountain. 200+ sandstone boulder problems. The short approach (a few
hundred feet from parking) makes it an easy-access option. Best paired with an HP40 day
since they are on the same corridor.

**Hours**: Dawn to dusk only. Gate requires a combination lock code, available through a
form on the SCC website. Lock the gate behind you on entry and exit.
Source: [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/hospitalboulders/)

#### Sunset Rock

Primarily a trad climbing area on Lookout Mountain, ~20-30 min from ESNP. Minimal
documented bouldering. Not a conditions-relevant area for this group.

#### Dogwood / Hell's Kitchen

Near Stone Fort; similar conditions profile (same mountain, similar elevation, same rock
type). Can be visited as a complement to or change of pace from Stone Fort when conditions
are good at that elevation. [UNVERIFIED — assumed similar conditions based on geographic
proximity]

## 3. Crowd Patterns

### Is February Peak Season?

February is near the end of peak bouldering season in the Southeast. The prime window
runs roughly October through March, with October-November and February-March being the
busiest periods due to ideal friction conditions. December-January can be strong but
colder weather deters some visitors.
Source: [Visit Chattanooga](https://www.visitchattanooga.com/blog/post/best-fall-climbing/); [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/stone-fort/)

### Stone Fort Crowd Levels

Stone Fort is the most popular bouldering area in the Southeast. It sees "hundreds of
visitors on a splitter day" during peak season. Key crowd factors:

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Weekend severity | High. Saturday is the worst day; Sunday slightly less |
| Weekday severity | Low-moderate. Weekdays in February are significantly less crowded |
| Competition impact | The Triple Crown Bouldering Series holds an event at Stone Fort annually (exact 2026 dates not confirmed — check [triplecrownbouldering.org](https://www.triplecrownbouldering.org/) before the trip) |
| Parking | Designated climber parking at Montlake Golf Course clubhouse. Can fill on busy weekends |
| Recommended arrival (weekend) | Before 9:00 AM to secure parking and beat crowds |
| Recommended arrival (weekday) | 9:00-10:00 AM is fine |

Source: [Every Last Rock](https://every-last-rock.com/stone-fort-aka-little-rock-city-bouldering/); [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/places/best-bouldering-climbing-chattanooga-tennessee/)

**Triple Crown warning**: If the Stone Fort Triple Crown event falls during Feb 14-21,
the area will be extremely crowded for the competition weekend. Typically the Stone Fort
event falls in late January or February. Verify the 2026 date before the trip and plan
to visit a different area on competition day.

### Rocktown Crowd Levels

Less crowded than Stone Fort but still popular during peak season. As a free-access
public area (no gate fee), it attracts budget-conscious climbers.

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Weekend severity | Moderate. Noticeably less than Stone Fort |
| Weekday severity | Low. Often have boulders to yourself |
| Parking | Dirt parking area at trailhead. Can fill on the busiest weekends but generally adequate |
| Recommended arrival | Before 10:00 AM on weekends; flexible on weekdays |

Source: [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/rocktown/); [Mojagear](https://mojagear.com/rock-climbing-rocktown-georgia/)

### HP40 Crowd Levels

HP40 is a private park with a day use fee, which provides some crowd moderation.
However, it is a nationally known destination and can draw significant crowds on
peak-season weekends.

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Weekend severity | Moderate-high (less than Stone Fort but still busy) |
| Weekday severity | Low. Monday-Wednesday can be very quiet (gate may even be closed; call ahead) |
| Competition impact | HP40 also hosts a Triple Crown event. Check dates. |
| Parking | Inside the park, generally adequate |
| Recommended arrival | Gate opens at 8:00 AM CT. Arrive at opening on weekends |

### Crowd Avoidance Strategy for the Trip

The group's trip runs Saturday Feb 14 through Saturday Feb 21 — two weekends bookending
five weekdays.

| Day | Recommended Strategy |
|-----|---------------------|
| Sat Feb 14 (arrival day) | If climbing: choose less-popular area (Rocktown, Walden's Ridge). Avoid Stone Fort on a Saturday. |
| Sun Feb 15 | Second weekend day. Consider HP40 (2-hr drive but gate controls crowd somewhat) or Rocktown. Stone Fort will still be busy. |
| Mon-Fri Feb 16-20 | Prime days for Stone Fort (weekday + peak friction season = best of both worlds). Use weekdays for the most popular areas. |
| Sat Feb 21 (departure day) | If climbing: quick session at Walden's Ridge (closest) or Stone Fort early before checkout. |

### Gate Hours Summary

| Area | Gate/Access Hours | Key Restriction | Source |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|--------|
| Stone Fort | Clubhouse hours (approx. sunrise-sunset) | Must check in and pay at clubhouse. $10 weekday / $12 weekend | [stoneforttn.com](https://www.stoneforttn.com/climbing) |

| Hospital Boulders | Dawn to dusk | Gate code required (request from SCC website) | [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/hospitalboulders/) |
| Rocktown | No gate; public access | Free. Archery closure (until 10 AM) runs Sep-Jan 1 only; should not affect Feb trip | [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/rocktown/) |
| Walden's Ridge | No gate [UNVERIFIED] | Public park; open access assumed | [Outdoor Chattanooga](https://outdoorchattanooga.com/waldens-ridge/) |

### Practical Climbing Window in February

The realistic climbing day for mid-February runs roughly **8:30 AM to 5:00 PM**, shaped
by multiple factors:

| Constraint | Effect on Window |
|------------|-----------------|
| Sunrise (~7:15-7:20 AM) | No useful climbing light before ~7:30 AM |
| Morning condensation | Dew/frost can persist until 9-10 AM on shaded boulders |
| Warmth for fingers | Below ~35F, most climbers cannot try hard. Hands need 10-15 min to warm between attempts |
| Peak friction | Typically 10 AM - 2 PM in February: rock has warmed above dew point but air is still cool |
| Sunset (~6:15-6:30 PM) | Usable light fades by ~5:30 PM; earlier in forested areas |
| Gate closures | HP40 closes at 6 PM CT; Dayton Pocket at 7 PM ET |

### When Does Friction Peak?

In winter, the best friction often occurs when sun is still on the rock in the
late morning to mid-afternoon. The mechanism:
1. Overnight, rock cools to near or below dew point, causing condensation
2. Morning sun warms rock surface above dew point, causing moisture to evaporate
3. Air temperature is still cool (40-55F), keeping skin dry and chalk effective
4. Peak friction window: approximately 10:00 AM - 2:00 PM on a sunny February day

Source: [Gripped Magazine](https://gripped.com/profiles/understanding-rock-climbing-conditions/); [UKC Forums](https://www.ukclimbing.com/forums/rock_talk/can_anyone_explain_humidity_to_me-678224)

On overcast days without morning sun, the friction window may shift later (rock takes
longer to warm above dew point) or may never fully open if the rock stays cool and
damp all day.

### HP40 Timing Note (Central Time Zone)

HP40 is in Alabama and operates on Central Time, one hour behind Chattanooga (Eastern).
The gate opens at 8 AM CT (= 9 AM ET). With a 2-hour drive from ESNP, leaving at 7 AM ET
gets you there at gate-opening. The gate closes at 6 PM CT (= 7 PM ET). Plan to be at
your car by 5:30 PM CT / 6:30 PM ET to pack up.

## 5. Skin Management

### How Abrasive Is Southeastern Sandstone?

Southeastern sandstone is significantly more abrasive than granite or polished limestone.
The rock is composed of compressed sand grains that essentially function like fine-grit
sandpaper. Extended sessions will wear through skin faster than at most gym or granite
destinations.

However, not all sandstone is equally abrasive. Texture varies by area:

| Area | Grain / Texture | Skin Impact | Dominant Style |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------------|
| Stone Fort | Fine-grained bullet sandstone | Moderate abrasion. Hard, dense rock wears skin steadily but not as aggressively as coarser stone | Mixed: slabs, crimps, slopers, edges |
| HP40 | Smooth, fine-grained | Lower abrasion (smoothest of the three). The polished surface is gentler on skin per attempt, but compression/sloper style means high contact area and lots of palm/finger pad wear | Slopers, compression, mantles |
| Rocktown | Coarse-grained | Highest abrasion. The rough texture that gives excellent friction also eats skin fastest. Huecos and chicken heads have sharp edges | Huecos, crimps, slopers, rails |
| Dayton Pocket | Similar to Stone Fort [UNVERIFIED] | Moderate. Roof climbing means more finger-intensive contact | Roof pockets, pinches |

Source: [Crux Crush](https://cruxcrush.com/bouldering-in-the-south/); [SCC](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/horse-pens-40/); [Mountain Project forums](https://www.mountainproject.com/forum/topic/108392119/stone-fort-vs-horse-pens-40)

### Slopers vs. Crimps: Which Are Worse for Skin?

| Hold Type | Skin Impact | Areas Most Affected |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|
| Crimps | Concentrated wear on fingertips, especially middle/ring finger. Can create splits at finger joints | Stone Fort, Rocktown |
| Slopers | Broad wear across finger pads and palms. Less likely to split but creates raw, thin patches over large areas | HP40, Rocktown |
| Huecos / Pockets | Localized wear. Can cause hot spots on specific fingers (typically index and middle) | Rocktown, Dayton Pocket |
| Compression | Generates friction across inner forearms, palms, and finger pads simultaneously. High total skin cost per attempt | HP40 |

### Recommended Pacing for a 7-Day Trip

Skin is the primary limiter on a week-long sandstone trip. Community consensus from
climbing forums and guides is clear: if you climb hard every day for 7 days on sandstone,
you will have no usable skin by day 4-5.

**Recommended pattern**:

| Day | Strategy | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Day 1 (Sat Feb 14) | Moderate volume at moderate grades | "Take the first day to do a bit of volume at moderate grades to get used to the rock." Do NOT project on day 1. This is reconnaissance and acclimatization. |
| Day 2 (Sun Feb 15) | Moderate-hard | Ramp up but monitor skin. Stop if tips feel thin. |
| Day 3 (Mon Feb 16) | Full send day | Skin is fresh, weekday crowds are low. This is your best day for hard sends. |
| Day 4 (Tue Feb 17) | Rest or light session | Skin needs recovery. Active rest (hike, explore) or very light climbing. Apply skin care products overnight. |
| Day 5 (Wed Feb 18) | Moderate-hard | Refreshed skin. Pick an area with smoother rock if tips are thin (HP40 over Rocktown). |
| Day 6 (Thu Feb 19) | Full send day #2 | Second peak effort day. Focus on remaining projects. |
| Day 7 (Fri Feb 20) | Light or rest | Preserve skin for optional day 8. If skin is done, this is a rest day. |
| Day 8 (Sat Feb 21) | Quick session or travel | If skin allows, one last morning session. Otherwise, travel day. |

**Key principle**: "There's nothing worse than going through a tip on day 2 and not
being able to try hard for the next few days." Preserve skin early; go hard later.

### Area Rotation Strategy for Skin Preservation

Rotating between areas with different rock textures and climbing styles spreads the wear
across different parts of the hand:

| If Skin Is... | Go To | Rationale |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| Fresh (days 1-2) | Rocktown or Stone Fort | Can handle coarser texture; full repertoire of styles |
| Getting thin (days 3-4) | HP40 | Smoother rock; less abrasive per attempt. But sloper volume adds up — limit sessions to 3-4 hours |
| Worn (days 5-6) | Stone Fort (crimp problems) or HP40 (low volume) | Avoid coarse Rocktown. Focus on specific problems, not volume |
| Wrecked | Rest day, indoor gym (High Point, Synergy), or non-climbing activity | Let skin recover fully. Apply salve/balm overnight |

### Skin Care Products and Practices

Community-recommended products and practices for multi-day sandstone trips:

**Evening / rest day care**:
- **Joshua Tree Climbing Salve**: Organic balm (beeswax, calendula, comfrey). Designed
  for climbers — moisturizes without softening calluses. Apply at night and on rest days.
  Source: [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/gear/7-balms-salves-and-tools-for-climbing-skin-care/)
- **ClimbOn Bar**: Similar all-natural balm. Widely available.
- **Rhino Skin Solutions Repair Cream**: Shea butter, tea tree oil, beeswax. Designed
  for post-session repair.
  Source: [Nature Climbing](https://natureclimbing.com/collections/rhino-skin-solutions)

**Pre-session care**:
- **Rhino Skin Solutions Performance / Antihydral (methenamine cream)**: Reduces sweating.
  Use sparingly — overuse causes painful splits. Apply the night before a big send day,
  not the morning of.
  Source: [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/gear/7-balms-salves-and-tools-for-climbing-skin-care/)

**During session**:
- Sand down any flappers or rough callus edges with a nail file or fine sandpaper
  (220-grit) to prevent tears
- Liquid bandage (e.g., New Skin) + climbing tape over splits to continue climbing
  on minor injuries
- Keep hands dry: chalk liberally, shake out between attempts
- Limit session length when skin is thin: 2-3 hours maximum

**General rules**:
- File calluses smooth every evening with sandpaper or pumice stone — rough callus edges
  catch and tear
- Moisturize at night to keep skin pliable (pliable skin resists splits better than
  brittle skin)
- Avoid soaking hands in water (dishwashing, swimming) which softens calluses
- Nutrition and hydration affect skin healing — stay hydrated and eat well

### Skill-Level Considerations for Skin

| Climber Level | Skin Risk | Notes |
|---------------|-----------|-------|
| V0-V1 | Lower | Shorter problems, fewer attempts per problem, lower intensity contact. Main risk is volume — doing 40 easy problems in a day is still lots of skin contact. |
| ~V5 | Moderate | Projecting at this level means 5-15 attempts on a problem. Monitor specific holds that create hot spots. |
| ~V10 | Higher | High-intensity contact, more attempts on harder moves, greater force on fingertips. Most likely to blow a tip on day 2-3. Pacing is critical. |

## 6. Southeastern Sandstone Primer

### How Sandstone Friction Differs from Granite and Limestone

Sandstone is composed of compressed sand grains (primarily quartz) bound by natural
cement. This structure creates millions of microscopic edges on the rock surface,
providing mechanical friction through interlocking of skin/rubber into these tiny
irregularities.

**Key differences from other rock types**:

| Property | Sandstone | Granite | Limestone |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Surface texture | Granular; micro-edges from compressed sand | Crystalline; large flat crystal faces with sharp edges | Smooth to pocketed; chemical rather than mechanical features |
| Friction coefficient | ~0.74 (highest) | ~0.65 [UNVERIFIED] | ~0.64 |
| Chalk effectiveness | Very high (+21% friction with chalk) | High | Moderate |
| Humidity sensitivity | Very high (porous; absorbs moisture) | Moderate (non-porous; surface moisture only) | Moderate-low (can be slippery when humid but doesn't absorb moisture) |
| Skin abrasion | High (sandpaper effect) | Moderate-high (sharp crystals) | Low-moderate (smoother surfaces) |
| Wet climbing safety | Dangerous — weakens when wet; damages holds | Generally safe | Generally safe |

### The Humidity-Friction Relationship

Sandstone's porous structure means it absorbs moisture from the air, not just from rain.
In humid conditions, the microscopic spaces between sand grains fill with water, which:
1. Creates a thin film of water on the surface, reducing skin/rubber-to-rock contact
2. Reduces the effectiveness of chalk (chalk absorbs the moisture, becoming saturated)
3. Makes the rock feel "greasy" — a common descriptor that means your hands slide
   where they should grip

**Dew point is the key metric, not relative humidity**. Why?

- Relative humidity is a percentage of how much moisture the air *can* hold at its
  current temperature. Cold air holds less moisture. So 80% humidity at 35F contains
  far less actual water vapor than 50% humidity at 75F.
- Dew point measures the absolute amount of water vapor in the air. It is the temperature
  at which the air would be saturated (100% RH).
- For climbing: **dew point below 40F = excellent friction. 40-50F = good. 50-60F =
  noticeably degraded. Above 60F = poor conditions regardless of relative humidity.**

Source: [Medium — Science Friction](https://medium.com/@loukusa/science-friction-62058792d565); [Gripped Magazine](https://gripped.com/profiles/understanding-rock-climbing-conditions/)

February in Chattanooga averages 31-33F dew points -- well in the "excellent" zone.

### What Temperature Is Ideal?

**Skin grips best in the 32-41F range** according to friction research, with variation by
individual (people who sweat more need colder conditions). Climbing shoe rubber has an
optimal temperature range as well: softer rubber compounds work better on colder rock,
while harder compounds need warmer rock to be effective.

For practical purposes:
- **Below 30F**: Too cold for most people. Numb fingers, painful crimping, shoe rubber
  can stiffen. Bring hand warmers.
- **32-50F**: Peak friction zone. This is what people mean by "send temps."
- **50-60F**: Good friction. Most climbers are comfortable.
- **Above 60F**: Friction begins to decline. Sweaty hands become an issue. Not typical
  for February Chattanooga, but possible on warm afternoons.

### Why "Cold and Dry" Is the Mantra

The phrase captures both sides of the friction equation:
- **Cold**: Keeps skin from sweating, keeps shoe rubber effective, keeps rock surface
  temperature above dew point (counter-intuitively — in winter, even cold rock is often
  above the very low dew point). Cold air also holds less moisture.
- **Dry**: Low dew point means less water vapor in the air, less condensation on rock
  surfaces, more effective chalk, and better skin-to-rock adhesion.

Together, cold + dry conditions create maximum friction on sandstone — which is why
October-March is peak bouldering season in the Southeast, and why February is
particularly prized.

### What "The Rock Feels Greasy" Means

When climbers say sandstone "feels greasy," they mean one or more of:
1. **Surface moisture**: A thin film of water from humidity, dew, or incomplete drying
   after rain. The water acts as a lubricant between skin and rock.
2. **Clay content**: Some sandstones contain clay minerals between grains. When wet,
   clay swells and becomes slippery. This is a particular issue with certain sandstone
   formations.
   Source: [Climbing Magazine](https://www.climbing.com/places/wet-sandstone/)
3. **Skin moisture**: The climber's own sweat on humid or warm days. This is exacerbated
   because chalk becomes less effective in humid air (it saturates faster).
4. **Temperature above optimal**: When rock is warm (above 55-60F), rubber compounds
   in climbing shoes become softer and less precise, and skin produces more oil and sweat.

**How to diagnose "greasy" in the field**: Press your palm flat against the rock for 2
seconds and remove it. If your hand slides at all during the press, or if you see a
damp mark where your hand was, conditions are suboptimal. If chalk leaves a visible
mark on the rock for more than a second, the rock is absorbing moisture — wait longer
for it to dry.

### Practical Checklist: Is Today a Good Sandstone Day?

Before leaving lodging, check these metrics:

| Metric | Good | Marginal | Avoid |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Dew point | Below 35F | 35-50F | Above 50F |
| Temperature (air) | 35-55F | 25-35F or 55-65F | Below 25F or above 65F |
| Recent rain | None in 48+ hours | None in 24-48 hours | Rain within 24 hours |
| Wind | Light-moderate (5-15 mph) | Calm or 15-25 mph | Sustained 25+ mph |
| Cloud cover | Clear or partly cloudy | Overcast (delays drying) | Active precipitation |

If the day is "Marginal" on rain: check for sheltered/overhanging problems or choose
an area with faster drying (exposed ridgetop locations like Rocktown > forested settings
like Stone Fort deep woods).
