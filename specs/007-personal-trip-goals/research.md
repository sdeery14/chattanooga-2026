**Branch**: `007-personal-trip-goals` | **Date**: 2026-02-09 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Research Summary

Four parallel research streams were conducted to inform Sean's personal guide:

1. **Climbing problem analysis** — Extracted all V0–V3 problems from Tier 1 and Tier 2 area problem clusters, plus V4+ problems with reach/power style notes
2. **Trail profile analysis** — Evaluated all 13 documented trail systems against Sean's bike (Jamis Faultline A2), skill level (athletic beginner), and riding goals (flow/XC + skill development)
3. **Brewery/restaurant research** — Web research for IPA-focused breweries, BBQ/burger/Southern restaurants, and coffee spots in Chattanooga
4. **Sights & experiences research** — Web research for viewpoints, walkable neighborhoods, oddities, shops, and cultural spots

## 1. Climbing Projects — Problem Selection for Sean's Profile

### Methodology

Sean climbs V1 outdoor / V4 gym. He's 6'2", 200 lbs, with explosive power, long reach, developing finger strength, tight hips, and bilateral ACL reconstruction history. Problems were filtered from existing Feature 002 problem clusters using these criteria:

**Select for**: Reachy/span moves, power pulls, good footholds, crimp ladders, short power sequences
**Flag/avoid**: High steps, drop-knees, aggressive heel hooks, sustained roofs, slab requiring hip turnover, tall boulders with bad landings

### Tier 2 Areas — Honest Assessments

| Area | V0–V3 Count | Verdict | Notes |
|------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Hospital Boulders | 7 | **Worth climbing** — best Tier 2 for easy grades | 7 problems across short approaches. Good rest-day or mixed-ability destination |
| Dayton Pocket | 2 | **Ride or spot** | Only 2 named V0–V3. Primary appeal is V5+ roof climbing |
| Walden's Ridge | 1 | **Ride or spot** | Only 1 named V0–V3. Primary strength is V4–V6 |
| Zahnd Tract | 1 | **Ride or spot** | 1 borderline V3/V4. Pair with Rocktown for Sean's climbing |

### Explicitly Tall/Powerful-Friendly Problems (All Areas)

| Problem | Grade | Area | Why |
|---------|-------|------|-----|
| **Genesis** | V3 | HP40 | REACHY — favors taller climbers. Undercling to pocket. |
| **The Scoop** | V2 | Rocktown | Reach helps for the top |
| **Mystery Groove** | V2 | Stone Fort | Body-type friendly — short and tall beta both work |
| **Redneck** | V6 | HP40 | REACHY — wingspan favors. (Moonshot territory) |

## 2. Mountain Biking — Trail Ranking for Sean

### Methodology

Sean rides a Jamis Faultline A2 (XL, 120/130mm full-suspension 29er trail bike). He's an athletic beginner who likes flow/XC and wants to develop trail/enduro skills. Trails were ranked by: (1) flow/XC quality, (2) skill-development progression, (3) February reliability (drainage), (4) drive time, (5) climbing-area pairing.

### Top Tier (Primary Rides)

| Rank | Trail | Drive | Miles | Style | Drainage | Why |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| **1** | **White Oak Mountain** | 15–25 min | 25 mi | Machine-built flow, stacked loops, 25-jump progression trail | **Excellent** | Best all-around option. 25 mi of stacked Green→Double Black loops. Machine-built flow perfectly matches Sean's style. Excellent drainage = reliable February riding. Open until 10 PM. |
| **2** | **Enterprise South** | 0 min | 15 mi | Flow, jumps, rhythm, pump track | **Good** | Home base at lodging. Green→Black progression. Pump track for daily skills. Black Forest (Green) for warm-up, TNT (Blue) for jumps, Atlas (Black) for progression. |
| **3** | **Coldwater Mountain** | 3–3.5 hrs (55 min from HP40) | 50–56 mi | IMBA Bronze, Bomb Dog flow trail | **Excellent** | World-class IMBA system. Bomb Dog (Blue) is signature flow trail — perfect for Sean. Only viable paired with HP40 climbing day (55 min drive from HP40). Open 365 days. |

### Second Tier (Good Backup)

| Rank | Trail | Drive | Miles | Style | Drainage | Why |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|-----|
| **4** | **Raccoon Mountain** | 30–40 min | 28–30 mi | Tech singletrack, 6 mi Green loops | **Moderate–Good** | Chattanooga flagship. 6 mi Green + flowing Blues for progression. Excellent Laurel Point facilities. Check SORBA daily for closures. Mountaintop = freeze/thaw risk. |
| **5** | **Stringer's Ridge** | 20–30 min | 7 mi | Urban, pump track, Green–Blue | **Moderate** | Quick urban session. Pump track at Spears Ave trailhead. 1–2 hours max. Good evening shake-out or rest-day supplement. |
| **6** | **Five Points** | 45–55 min | 20–25 mi | Diverse, Green–Black, unique industrial character | **Unknown** | Unique terrain (old coal mining), less crowded. Pairs with Rocktown/Zahnd. But: unknown drainage + drive time + $5 cash fee. Verify conditions before committing. |

### Skip for This Trip

| Trail | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Booker T. Washington | Poor drainage, technical not flow, short (7 mi) |
| Walden's Ridge Park | Gravity/DH — wrong style for athletic beginner. DO NOT RIDE WET |
| Lookout Mountain | Descent-oriented, technical, unverified access |
| Pigeon Mountain | WMA hunting restrictions make February access uncertain. Rugged/ungroomed |
| Chickamauga Battlefield | Paved roads — not MTB. Rain-day fallback only |
| Oak Mountain | 2.5 hrs each way. Only viable as standalone mission, no climbing pairing |

### Climbing-Area Pairing Matrix (Sean-Specific)

| Group is climbing at... | Sean's best ride option | Drive from area | Notes |
|------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| Stone Fort | Enterprise South (return to lodging) | ~35–45 min back | Or Raccoon Mountain (~30–40 min from Stone Fort) |
| Rocktown | Five Points (~25–40 min) | ~25–40 min | Verify drainage. Fallback: return to lodging for Enterprise South |
| HP40 | **Coldwater Mountain** (~55 min) | ~55 min from HP40 | Sean's best long-ride opportunity. Bomb Dog is the target |
| Walden's Ridge | Enterprise South or Stringer's Ridge | ~25–35 min back | Close to lodging — ride at home base |
| Dayton Pocket | Return to lodging for Enterprise South | ~50–65 min back | Nothing rideable nearby |
| Hospital Boulders | Coldwater Mountain (~1 hr) | ~1 hr | Same Alabama trip direction |

### February Drainage Reliability

| Reliability | Trails |
|------------|--------|
| **Ride anytime** | White Oak Mountain, Coldwater Mountain, Chickamauga (paved) |
| **Generally reliable** | Enterprise South, Raccoon Mountain (check SORBA) |
| **Check conditions** | Stringer's Ridge, Five Points |
| **Avoid in wet** | Booker T. Washington, Walden's Ridge Park, Lookout Mountain, Pigeon Mountain |

## Research Decisions Summary

| Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| Rank White Oak Mountain #1 for biking | Best drainage, most miles (25), stacked progression, machine-built flow, 10 PM close | Enterprise South (closer but fewer miles), Raccoon Mountain (more technical, freeze/thaw risk) |
| Curate climbing picks for Tier 1 only + Hospital Boulders | Tier 2 areas (except Hospital) have 1–2 V0–V3 problems — not worth curating | Curating all areas (rejected — would produce filler recommendations) |
| Three-brewery IPA crawl on Southside | Hutton & Smith + Five Wits + Chattanooga Brewing all walkable, all strong IPA programs | Including OddStory/WanderLinger (rejected — not IPA focused) |
| Sugar's Ribs as #1 BBQ pick | Half-price ribs Tue–Thu aligns perfectly with mid-week trip schedule | Little Coyote (Michelin Bib Gourmand — more upscale than Sean's stated casual preference) |
| Tremont Tavern as #1 burger pick | Voted best burger in Chattanooga multiple times. Niedlov's rolls connection | Urban Stack (more upscale/gourmet), Nic & Norman's (bison is unique but location less convenient) |
| Coldwater Mountain paired with HP40 day | Only 55 min from HP40 vs. 3.5 hrs from lodging. World-class IMBA system | Oak Mountain (2.5 hrs — too far for parallel day) |
| Skip Walden's Ridge Park, Lookout Mountain, Pigeon Mountain for biking | Wrong style (gravity/DH, descent, ungroomed) for athletic beginner flow/XC preference + February access concerns | Riding them anyway for "experience" (rejected — skill/bike mismatch creates frustration and risk) |
