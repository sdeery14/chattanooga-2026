# Quickstart: Renting a Mountain Bike

**Feature**: 009-bike-rentals
**Date**: 2026-02-10

## The 2-Minute Version

1. **Book a bike from Chattanooga Guided Adventures**: [Pelago booking link](https://www.pelago.com/en-US/activity/pdj0pi8aq-mountain-bike-rentals-by-chattanooga-guided-adventures-chattanooga/). $89/24 hrs. Includes helmet, lock, tube. Pick the **Trek Roscoe** (best for beginners — 27.5+ tires, dropper post).

2. **Request delivery to Enterprise South Nature Park** (at lodging) or Coolidge Park downtown. [UNVERIFIED: confirm ESNP delivery is available — may be outside free delivery zone.]

3. **Ride Black Forest at Enterprise South**: ~3 miles, Green-rated, smooth flow. Warm up on the pump track first. Zero drive time.

4. **When done**: Lock the bike, call CGA, they pick it up.

## Before You Go

- Wear athletic clothes (no jeans) and closed-toe shoes with grippy soles
- Bring water, phone, sunscreen
- Helmet is included with rental
- CGA will size the bike to you at delivery

## If It's Raining

Check [SORBA Chattanooga](https://www.sorbachattanooga.org/) for trail status. If trails are closed:
- **White Oak Mountain** drains fastest — may reopen before other trails
- **Chickamauga Battlefield** paved roads are always rideable (not mountain biking, but a nice ride)
- Or skip biking and join the climbing group

## If It's Sunday

- CGA should be available (delivery-based) [UNVERIFIED]
- Suck Creek Cycle is **closed Sundays**
- REI Chattanooga is typically open Sundays [UNVERIFIED: confirm hours]
