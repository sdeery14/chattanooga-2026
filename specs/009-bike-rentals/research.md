## 1. Rental Shop Options

### 1a. Chattanooga Guided Adventures (Primary Recommendation)

**What**: Mobile mountain bike rental service — delivers bikes to your door or a trailhead. No brick-and-mortar shop to visit.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Website** | [chattanoogaguidedadventures.com](https://www.chattanoogaguidedadventures.com/kayakrental) |
| **Booking** | Online via [Pelago](https://www.pelago.com/en-US/activity/pdj0pi8aq-mountain-bike-rentals-by-chattanooga-guided-adventures-chattanooga/) or [Visit Chattanooga](https://www.visitchattanooga.com/event/mountain-bike-rental-with-chattanooga-guided-adventures/19809/) |
| **Phone** | [UNVERIFIED — check website for current contact] |
| **Pricing** | $89/24 hrs, $149/48 hrs, $209/72 hrs |
| **Bikes** | Trek Roscoe (27.5+, 120mm fork, dropper, 11-spd), Scott Aspect 950 (29", 100mm, 18-spd), Polygon Xtrada 27.5 (2x10) |
| **Included** | All Mountain MIPS helmet, keyless bike lock, spare tube |
| **NOT included** | Water, snacks, shoes, gloves, riding clothing |
| **Delivery** | Free delivery/pickup in Coolidge Park area. Trailhead delivery available [UNVERIFIED: may have additional fee for locations outside downtown] |
| **Reservation** | Online booking with instant confirmation. Free cancellation up to 2 days before. No refund if cancelled day-of |
| **Sunday** | Available (delivery-based, not storefront-dependent) [UNVERIFIED] |
| **February notes** | [UNVERIFIED: confirm winter availability — this is an outdoor adventure company that may have reduced winter operations] |

**Why recommended**: Delivery model eliminates the need to drive to a shop, pick up a bike, figure out a rack, and then drive to a trail. A renter can have a bike waiting at the trailhead. The Trek Roscoe with dropper post and 27.5+ tires is genuinely good for a beginner — stable, forgiving, and modern geometry.

**Concerns**: $89/day is not cheap. Delivery to Enterprise South (outside downtown core) may incur extra fees or not be available — must verify. Winter availability is unconfirmed.

### 1b. Suck Creek Cycle

**What**: Chattanooga's premier local MTB shop. Primarily sales and service, but has offered rentals per customer reviews.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Address** | 630 W Bell Ave, Chattanooga, TN 37405 (North Shore) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~20-25 min |
| **Website** | [suckcreek.com](https://suckcreek.com/) |
| **Phone** | 423-266-8883 |
| **Email** | suckcreekcycle@gmail.com |
| **Hours** | Mon–Thu 10am–6pm, Fri 10am–5pm, Sat 8:30am–3pm |
| **Sunday** | **CLOSED** |
| **Rentals** | [UNVERIFIED — website does not list rental program. Customer reviews mention renting bikes. Call to confirm availability, pricing, and bike types] |
| **Brands** | Yeti, Santa Cruz, Orbea, Ibis, Norco, Juliana |
| **February notes** | Standard hours. Closed Sundays. Best local trail intel — worth visiting even if renting elsewhere |

**Why included**: Even if they don't rent bikes, Suck Creek is the #1 source for current trail conditions and local beta. If they do rent, the bikes will be high-end. Already documented in the repo as a gear shop.

**Concerns**: Rental program is unverified. Closed Sundays is a significant gap for a vacation trip. If they rent, pricing is likely higher than CGA due to premium bike brands.

### 1c. REI Chattanooga

**What**: National outdoor retailer with bike shop.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Address** | 2507 Lifestyle Way, Chattanooga, TN 37421 (Hamilton Place) |
| **Drive from lodging** | ~10-15 min |
| **Website** | [rei.com/stores/chattanooga](https://www.rei.com/stores/chattanooga/bike-shop) |
| **Phone** | 423-485-1249 (bike shop direct) |
| **Hours** | [UNVERIFIED — typical REI: Mon–Sat 10am–9pm, Sun 10am–7pm] |
| **Sunday** | Open (typical REI hours) |
| **Rentals** | [UNVERIFIED — REI rental programs vary by store. Some locations rent mountain bikes, others do not. Call to confirm Chattanooga availability] |
| **Pricing** | [UNVERIFIED — REI typical: ~$60-90/day for mountain bikes] |
| **February notes** | Presidents' Day (Feb 16) may have holiday hours |

**Why included**: Open Sundays (unlike Suck Creek). Closest shop to lodging. REI's rental program (where available) includes helmet and basic kit. Familiar brand — low anxiety for a first-timer.

**Concerns**: Rental program at this specific location is unverified. REI rental bikes tend to be basic hardtails — fine for a beginner but not the experience Chattanooga Guided Adventures offers. REI staff won't have the local trail knowledge that Suck Creek does.

### 1d. Hamilton County Parks Bike Rentals

**What**: County-operated bike rental at Tennessee Riverpark.

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Locations** | Boat Ramp Area (Hubert Fry Center) and Curtain Pole Entrance, Tennessee Riverpark |
| **Phone** | 888-925-4415 |
| **Provider** | Chattanooga Bicycle Transit System |

**Decision**: **Excluded from guide**. These are urban/greenway bikes (Bike Chattanooga transit system), not mountain bikes. Not suitable for trail riding.

## 2. Beginner-Friendly Trail Analysis

Based on existing trail profiles in the repo and supplemental research:

### Tier 1: Recommended for First-Timers

| Trail | Loop | Miles | Drive | Why |
|-------|------|-------|-------|-----|
| **Enterprise South — Black Forest** | Green loop | ~3 mi | 0 min | Smoothest singletrack in the area. Gentle rollers, wide turns. Pump track at trailhead for warm-up. Zero drive time. |
| **White Oak Mountain — Green Loop** | Green loop (Rolling Green, Hidden Spring, Valley, Dogwood segments) | ~1.7 mi | ~15-25 min | Machine-built flow. Stacked loop system — beginner stays near parking. Excellent drainage. Open until 10 PM. |

### Tier 2: Conditional Recommendations

| Trail | Loop | Miles | Drive | Why | Caveat |
|-------|------|-------|-------|-----|--------|
| **Chickamauga Battlefield** | Paved road tour | ~12.6 mi (shortenable) | ~25-35 min | Flat, paved, zero technical features. Always rideable. | Not mountain biking — road riding. Use as fallback if beginner dislikes singletrack. |
| **Stringer's Ridge — Pump Track** | Pump track only | Small circuit | ~20-30 min | Great skills practice in controlled environment. | Singletrack network is Green-Blue mixed with no isolated beginner loop. Not recommended beyond the pump track for a true beginner. |

### Not Recommended for First-Timers

| Trail | Why Not |
|-------|---------|
| Booker T. Washington | All Blue. Gnarly, rooty, steep climbs/descents. |
| Raccoon Mountain | Even "Green" trails are considered tough beginner. 30-40 min drive. |
| Walden's Ridge Park | Blue to Double Black gravity/DH. |
| Lookout Mountain | Blue to Black descent trails. |
| Five Points | Green–Black but 45-55 min drive; too far for a first-time rental ride. |

## 3. Climbing-to-Rental-Ride Pairings

Using the existing Climbing Area Pairing Matrix and filtering for beginner-appropriate trails:

| Climbing Area | Rental Approach | Beginner Trail | Logistics |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Stone Fort** | Book CGA delivery to Stringer's Ridge or rent from Suck Creek (Mon-Sat) | Stringer's pump track → Enterprise South Black Forest | Rider does pump track (~20 min) near Stone Fort area, then rides ESNP Black Forest on way home. Group meets at lodging. ~3-4 hr half-day. |
| **Walden's Ridge** | Book CGA delivery to Enterprise South or pick up from Suck Creek | Enterprise South Black Forest | Rider stays at lodging and rides ESNP while group climbs Walden's Ridge (~25-35 min away). Simplest logistics — no coordination needed. |
| **Rocktown / Zahnd** | Not practical for beginner rental | N/A | Nearest beginner trails are 40+ min from climbing area. Skip biking on Rocktown days unless rider is comfortable doing an independent ESNP ride. |
| **HP40** | Not practical | N/A | HP40 is ~2 hrs from lodging. Coldwater Mountain (nearest trail) is intermediate+. No beginner option within range. |

## 4. First-Timer Guidance Research

### What to Wear
- Athletic shorts or pants (no jeans — chafing + restriction)
- Moisture-wicking shirt (no cotton — sweat management)
- Closed-toe shoes with grippy soles (trail runners or hiking shoes work; no sandals)
- Sunglasses (trail debris protection)
- Light gloves recommended but not required

### What the Rental Includes (CGA)
- Bike, helmet (MIPS), lock, spare tube

### What to Bring
- Water (at least 1 bottle, ideally a hydration pack)
- Phone (for emergency + trail maps)
- Snacks for rides over 1 hour
- Sunscreen
- Small first-aid basics (band-aids, antiseptic) — optional but smart

### Sizing
- Rental companies size bikes at delivery/pickup based on rider height
- General reference: 5'4"–5'8" = Small, 5'8"–6'0" = Medium, 6'0"–6'4" = Large
- CGA will handle sizing at delivery

### Basic Trail Etiquette
- Yield to hikers and horses (bikes yield to everyone)
- Don't ride muddy trails (ruts persist for years) — if tires leave ruts deeper than 1/2 inch, turn back
- Stay on marked trails
- Call out "on your left" when passing
- Don't brake-slide / skid — damages trail surface
