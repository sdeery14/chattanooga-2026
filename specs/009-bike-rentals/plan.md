# Implementation Plan: Mountain Bike Rentals & Group Riding

**Branch**: `009-bike-rentals` | **Date**: 2026-02-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/009-bike-rentals/spec.md`

## Summary

Create a standalone rental guide (`trails/bike-rentals.md`) that helps non-bikers in the group rent a mountain bike and join Sean for a ride. Content covers rental shop options (with Chattanooga Guided Adventures as the primary recommendation), beginner-friendly trail picks, climbing-day pairing logistics, and first-timer tips. Cross-reference links are added to `trails/README.md` and `rest-days/README.md`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (GitHub-Flavored)
**Primary Dependencies**: None — static documentation
**Storage**: Flat markdown files in `trails/` directory
**Testing**: Manual review — verify links, tables render, [UNVERIFIED] tags present
**Target Platform**: GitHub web (rendered markdown)
**Project Type**: Knowledge base (no source code)
**Performance Goals**: N/A
**Constraints**: Must be skimmable under fatigue; must follow existing repo conventions
**Scale/Scope**: 1 new file (`trails/bike-rentals.md`), 2 files edited for cross-references

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I. Decision-Support First | **PASS** | Guide answers "how do I rent a bike and where do I ride?" — direct decision support. Skimmable table format. Optionality preserved (multiple shops, multiple trails). |
| II. Bouldering Scope Boundary | **PASS** | Feature is about mountain biking, which is explicitly in-scope per vision.md. No climbing content is modified. |
| III. Ability-Aware, Hard-Climbing Priority | **N/A** | This feature serves the biking participant, not climbing area selection. Does not dilute climbing priorities. |
| IV. Mountain Biking as First-Class Activity | **PASS** | This feature directly advances Principle IV by expanding biking access to the whole group. |
| V. Source Accuracy & Recency | **PASS** | All research cites sources. Unverified details tagged with [UNVERIFIED]. Pricing dated to research date. |

**Content Quality Gates**:
1. Skimmability: Yes — comparison tables, ranked lists, bullet-point tips
2. Decision-orientation: Yes — "where to rent, which trail, how to pair with climbing"
3. Scope: Yes — mountain biking content only
4. Ability coverage: N/A (biking feature, not climbing)
5. Source: Yes — all claims sourced or flagged

**Post-design re-check**: All gates still pass.

## Project Structure

```

### Content Files (repository root)

```text
trails/
├── bike-rentals.md      # NEW — standalone rental guide (all 4 user stories)
├── README.md            # EDIT — add cross-reference link to bike-rentals.md
└── [existing profiles]  # Unchanged

rest-days/
└── README.md            # EDIT — add cross-reference near existing biking note
```

**Structure Decision**: New standalone file `trails/bike-rentals.md` rather than a section in `trails/README.md`. The rental guide has 7 content sections (shop comparison, detailed profiles, beginner trails, climbing pairings, first-timer tips, February notes, quickstart). This is too much content for a subsection and would bloat the existing README which is already a full comparison table + pairing matrix.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Rental Guide

Create `trails/bike-rentals.md` with:

1. **Header + context block** — Who this is for, trip dates, lodging reference, "2-minute version" summary at top
2. **Rental Shop Comparison Table** — Side-by-side: CGA vs Suck Creek vs REI. Columns: name, type, pricing, hours, Sunday, bikes, included, reservation, verified
3. **Detailed Shop Profiles** — One subsection per shop with full research from `research.md`
4. **Beginner-Friendly Trails** — Ranked list: Enterprise South Black Forest (#1), White Oak Green Loop (#2), Chickamauga fallback (#3), Stringer's pump track (#4). Each with distance, drive time, why it's good, concerns
5. **Climbing Day Pairings** — Table: climbing area → rental approach → trail → time budget → feasibility
6. **First-Timer Tips** — What to wear, what's included, what to bring, sizing, etiquette
7. **February Considerations** — Weather, trail closures, Presidents' Day weekend, Sunday closures

### Phase 2: Cross-References

1. Add link to `trails/bike-rentals.md` in `trails/README.md` — in or near the "Rest-Day Rides" section
2. Update existing biking cross-reference note in `rest-days/README.md` to also mention rental option

### Phase 3: Verification

1. Verify all internal links resolve (trail profiles, area profiles)
2. Verify [UNVERIFIED] tags are present for all unconfirmed details
3. Verify table formatting renders correctly in GitHub markdown
