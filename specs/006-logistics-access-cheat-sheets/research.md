## 1. Drive Times from ESNP

All times are estimates based on typical driving conditions. Actual times vary with traffic, weather, and road conditions. ESNP reference address: 501 Greenway View Dr, Chattanooga, TN 37421.

### Tier 1 Areas

| Area | Drive Time | Distance | Route | Time Zone | Road Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Stone Fort (LRC) | ~35–45 min | ~25 mi | I-27 N / US-27 N to Soddy-Daisy, then local roads to Mowbray Mountain | Eastern | Paved roads throughout. Short section of mountain road to clubhouse. |
| Rocktown | ~50–70 min | ~40–45 mi | I-24 W into Georgia, then GA-193 S to Pigeon Mountain. Last stretch is gravel/dirt WMA road up the mountain. | Eastern | **Last ~3 miles is unpaved WMA road up Pigeon Mountain.** Can be rutted, muddy, or icy in February. 4WD recommended after rain. [UNVERIFIED — specific road condition for Feb 2026] |
| HP40 | ~2 hrs | ~100 mi | I-24 W to I-59 S into Alabama, exit near Steele, AL, then local roads up Chandler Mountain | **Central** (1 hr behind) | Paved throughout. Mountain road to HP40 is steep and winding. **Time zone crossing — all HP40 hours are Central Time.** |

### Tier 2 Areas

| Area | Drive Time | Distance | Route | Time Zone | Road Notes |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Dayton Pocket | ~50–65 min | ~40 mi | US-27 N to Dayton, TN, then local roads to Laurel Snow State Natural Area | Eastern | Paved. Last stretch is narrow rural road to parking area. |
| Walden's Ridge | ~25–35 min | ~15 mi | W Road / Signal Mountain area. Shortest drive of any area. | Eastern | Paved throughout. Easy access. |
| Hospital Boulders | ~1.5–2 hrs | ~90 mi | I-24 W to I-59 S toward Gadsden, AL. Same corridor as HP40. | **Central** (1 hr behind) | Paved. **Same corridor as HP40** — natural pairing for a multi-area day. |
| Dogwood | ~45–55 min | ~30 mi | North toward Graysville, TN. Cumberland Trail State Park. | Eastern | Paved. [UNVERIFIED — specific road to parking area] |
| Hell's Kitchen | ~40–50 min | ~28 mi | Near Graysville, TN. Adjacent to Cumberland Trail. | Eastern | [UNVERIFIED — road conditions and exact directions] |
| Zahnd Tract | ~50–60 min | ~40 mi | I-24 W into Georgia, GA-157. Only 15 min from Rocktown. | Eastern | Paved. Parking area can be hard to spot off GA-157. |
| Sunset Rock | ~20–30 min | ~12 mi | Lookout Mountain, Cravens House area. | Eastern | Paved. Short drive but **not a meaningful bouldering destination**. |

### Road Condition Concerns for February

- **Rocktown (Pigeon Mountain WMA road)**: The unpaved WMA road up Pigeon Mountain can become muddy, rutted, or icy after winter precipitation. Check road conditions before committing to the drive. If road is impassable, Rocktown is inaccessible. [UNVERIFIED — specific February 2026 conditions]
- **HP40 (Chandler Mountain)**: Steep, winding mountain road. Generally paved and maintained, but ice is possible on cold mornings. Drive carefully.
- **Dayton Pocket (Laurel Snow access)**: Rural road may have limited winter maintenance. Generally passable but narrow.
- **All mountain roads**: February can bring freezing rain or light snow to the Chattanooga area (~1.85 inches average snowfall). Mountain roads above 1,500 ft are most susceptible. Check forecasts and NWS advisories before driving mountain routes.

## 3. Parking & Approach

| Area | Parking Location | Capacity | Approach Distance | Approach Time | Pad Carry | Notes |
|------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| Stone Fort | Montlake Golf Course clubhouse (9104 Brow Lake Rd, Soddy-Daisy, TN 37379) | Medium lot; can fill on peak weekends | Short | 5–15 min | Easy — flat to gentle terrain | Must check in at clubhouse first |
| Rocktown | WMA access road parking area at top of Pigeon Mountain | Dirt lot; fills on busy weekends | Moderate | 5–10 min (front), 15–20 min (back areas) | Moderate — trail is established but some rocky terrain | 15–20 min approach provides natural warmup |
| HP40 | On-site parking within private park | Adequate | Very short | 2–5 min | Easy — flat park grounds | Boulders scattered throughout park |
| Dayton Pocket | Laurel Snow State Natural Area parking | Small lot | **Long — significant elevation change (~1,000 ft)** | 30–45 min [UNVERIFIED] | Difficult — steep trail with heavy pads | Not a quick access area |

| Hospital Boulders | Near Mountain View Hospital off I-59, Gadsden area | Small lot | Very short | 2–3 min (few hundred feet) | Easy — minimal approach | Easiest approach of any area |

## 4. Multi-Area Day Pairings

### Pairing 1: Alabama Corridor — HP40 + Hospital Boulders

- **Drive**: ESNP → HP40 (~2 hrs) → Hospital Boulders (~30–40 min from HP40) → ESNP (~1.5–2 hrs)
- **Total drive time**: ~4–4.5 hrs round trip
- **Why it works**: Both on the I-59 Alabama corridor. Visit HP40 for the morning send window (10 AM – 2 PM CT), then stop at Hospital Boulders on the way back for a lighter afternoon session.
- **Logistics**: Leave ESNP by 7 AM ET. Arrive HP40 at gate opening (8 AM CT / 9 AM ET). Climb HP40 until ~2–3 PM CT. Drive to Hospital Boulders (~30 min). Climb until dusk (~5:30 PM CT). Drive home.
- **Time zone note**: HP40 and Hospital Boulders are both Central Time.

### Pairing 2: Georgia Ridge — Rocktown + Zahnd Tract

- **Drive**: ESNP → Rocktown (~50–70 min) → Zahnd (~15 min from Rocktown) → ESNP (~50–60 min)
- **Total drive time**: ~2–2.5 hrs round trip
- **Why it works**: Zahnd is only 15 minutes from Rocktown on the same Georgia ridge. If conditions at Rocktown are foggy or you want a change of pace, Zahnd offers a different vibe (uncrowded, fine-grained sandstone) with minimal extra driving.
- **Logistics**: Same WMA license covers both areas. Visit Rocktown in the morning, Zahnd in the afternoon.

### Pairing 3: Mowbray Mountain Cluster — Stone Fort + Dogwood

- **Drive**: ESNP → Stone Fort (~35–45 min) → Dogwood (~20–30 min from Stone Fort) [UNVERIFIED] → ESNP (~45–55 min)
- **Total drive time**: ~2–2.5 hrs round trip [UNVERIFIED]
- **Why it works**: Both areas are on the Cumberland Plateau north of Chattanooga with bullet sandstone. If Stone Fort is too crowded (weekend) or you've already spent several days there, Dogwood offers fresh problems in the V3–V7 range.
- **Logistics**: Register at dogwoodclimbing.com before visiting Dogwood.

### Pairing 4: Quick Local Session — Walden's Ridge + Sunset Rock (viewpoint)

- **Drive**: ESNP → Walden's Ridge (~25–35 min) → Sunset Rock (~15 min) → ESNP (~20–30 min)
- **Total drive time**: ~1–1.5 hrs round trip
- **Why it works**: Both are on/near Signal Mountain/Lookout Mountain. Climb at Walden's Ridge in the morning, then catch the sunset viewpoint at Sunset Rock (scenic, not for bouldering). Good for arrival/departure days.
- **Logistics**: Free access at both. No registration required for Walden's Ridge.

## 5. Critical Access Warnings ("Don't Screw This Up")

### Pre-Trip Action Items

1. **Purchase Georgia WMA license** at [gooutdoorsgeorgia.com](https://gooutdoorsgeorgia.com) — required for Rocktown and Zahnd Tract. Rangers ticket on-site. Non-resident one-day fishing pass ~$10.
2. **Request Hospital Boulders gate code** from [SCC website](https://www.seclimbers.org/project/hospitalboulders/) — you cannot enter without it.
3. **Register for Dayton Pocket climbing** through the TN State Parks online system.
4. **Register at dogwoodclimbing.com** if planning to visit Dogwood.
5. **Check Triple Crown dates** at [triplecrownbouldering.org](https://www.triplecrownbouldering.org/) — competition could affect Stone Fort or HP40 during the trip window. [UNVERIFIED — 2026 dates]
6. **Confirm Stone Fort hours/fees** by calling (423) 332-3111 [UNVERIFIED — phone number].
7. **Check HP40 hours** at [hp40.weebly.com](https://hp40.weebly.com/hours-of-operation.html) — weekday hours may vary (Mon–Wed may be closed; call ahead at 256-458-3545).

### Day-Of Warnings

1. **HP40 time zone trap**: HP40 operates on Central Time. The gate closes at 6 PM CT, which is 7 PM Eastern. Leave ESNP by 7 AM ET to arrive at gate opening. Be at your car by 5:30 PM CT.
2. **Dayton Pocket lock-in**: The gate is locked at 7 PM ET by the caretaker. If you are still inside, you WILL be locked in overnight. Plan to exit by 6:30 PM ET.
3. **Stone Fort clubhouse check-in**: You MUST check in and pay at the Montlake Golf Course clubhouse BEFORE climbing. Do not skip straight to the boulders.
4. **Hospital Boulders property boundary**: SCC does not own the entire boulder field. Watch for "End SCC Property" signs. Climbing beyond them is trespassing on private land.
5. **Rocktown WMA road after rain**: The last 3 miles of dirt/gravel road up Pigeon Mountain can become muddy or icy. If you're unsure about road conditions, don't attempt it — a stuck car ruins the day. [UNVERIFIED — specific Feb 2026 conditions]
