## February Riding Conditions — Chattanooga Area

### Climate

- **Average February high**: 49-53 F (9-12 C)
- **Average February low**: 31-34 F (0-1 C)
- **Rainfall**: ~4.8-6.0 inches for the month, making February one of the wetter months
- **Chance of precipitation on any given day**: ~41%

**Confidence**: Confirmed (NWS Chattanooga climate data, Weather Spark, AccuWeather)

### Trail Ridability in February

Trails are **generally rideable** in February but with significant caveats:

1. **Freeze/thaw cycles** are the primary concern. SORBA Chattanooga has written extensively about this: trails frozen in the AM can become "a sloppy, slushy mess" by mid-morning as temperatures rise. Riding during thaw creates deep ruts that persist for years. **Ride early (frozen = OK) or wait for full thaw and dry-out.**

2. **Post-rain recovery**: Most trails need 24-36 hours to dry after significant rain. The rule is: if your tires are leaving ruts deeper than 1/2 inch, turn around.

3. **No blanket seasonal closures** in the Chattanooga area — trails close situationally based on conditions. SORBA Chattanooga posts status updates on their website for the systems they steward.

4. **Best drainage trails for wet-weather riding**: White Oak Mountain (Biology Trails) drains "VERY well" and is frequently cited as the go-to after rain. Enterprise South has rock-lined trails that drain quickly. Raccoon Mountain has a reputation for reasonable drainage due to rocky soil, but SORBA still closes it during wet conditions. Upper Truck Trail on Lookout Mountain (gravel/road bed) is cited as a viable wet-weather option.

5. **Worst drainage / most closure-prone**: Walden's Ridge Park explicitly states "DO NOT RIDE WET TRAILS." Booker T Washington State Park advises against riding in wet conditions. Stringers Ridge has had mudslide-related closures.

**Confidence**: Confirmed (SORBA Chattanooga freeze/thaw article, multiple trail condition reports, Trailforks, Singletracks)

**Key resource**: Check [SORBA Chattanooga](https://www.sorbachattanooga.org/) for current trail status before riding any day in February.

- **February status**: Open year-round. Hours vary seasonally based on sunset (approximately 7:00 AM - 5:30/6:30 PM in winter). **Note: Park closed Saturday 2/14/26** (per Yelp listing — verify with park).
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Moderate — rock-lined trails help but not immune.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Multiple parking areas throughout the 2,800-acre park
- **Fees**: Free (Hamilton County park — no fee mentioned in any source)
- **Hours**: ~7:00 AM to 5:30-6:30 PM in February (varies with sunset; call 423-209-5350 to confirm)

### 2. Raccoon Mountain

**Location**: Raccoon Mountain Rd, Chattanooga, TN (west side of Chattanooga, atop TVA pumped-storage facility)
**Drive from lodging**: ~30-40 min from ESNP area (15 min from downtown, ESNP is ~15 min NE of downtown = ~30-40 min total across the city)
**Total rideable trail miles**: ~28-30 miles
**Difficulty range**: Green through Black — primarily Blue (intermediate) and Black (advanced/expert)
**Confidence**: Confirmed (multiple sources)

#### Trail Breakdown

| Category | Miles | Notable Trails |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| Easy (Green) | ~6 mi | Beginner-friendly loops |
| Intermediate (Blue) | Multiple | East Rim, Electric Avenue 1, Small Intestine (fast, flowy) |
| Difficult (Black) | Multiple | Live Wire (technical rock), High Voltage (steep DH), Grindstone Ridge |
| Total | ~28 mi | 2 easy, 9 intermediate, 11 difficult trails (per MTB Project) |

**Style/character**: "Real" mountain biking — narrow singletrack through forest, roots, rocks, steep pitches, flow sections. A mix of technical riding and fast descents. This is Chattanooga's flagship MTB destination. Stacked loop system winding around the TVA reservoir on the mountaintop.

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: MODERATE-GOOD. Rocky terrain helps drainage, and the trail has a reputation for being rideable "shortly after rain." However, SORBA-Chattanooga still closes trails during heavy rain or freeze-thaw conditions. Do NOT ride when muddy.
- **February status**: Open year-round, sunrise to sunset (hours posted as sunrise to 7:30 PM in general, but sunset is earlier in February). SORBA may close trails due to conditions — check their site.
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Moderate — mountaintop location means colder temps and more freeze/thaw risk than valley trails.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: 3 trailhead parking areas on top (Laurel Point is best — has restrooms, bike wash, repair stand, changing rooms, water fountain). East Overlook and Switchyard also on top. 2 areas at bottom (Massengale Point, Boat Ramp). DO NOT park at the TVA Visitor's Center.
- **Fees**: Free (TVA land, no entrance fee mentioned in any source)
- **Hours**: Sunrise to sunset year-round. TVA Visitor Center hours Nov-May: 11 AM - 3 PM.

### 12. Pigeon Mountain (near Rocktown)

**Location**: Crockford-Pigeon Mountain Wildlife Management Area, LaFayette, GA
**Drive from lodging**: ~50-70 min from ESNP area (same drive as Rocktown climbing)
**Total rideable trail miles**: ~12-15 miles [UNVERIFIED — mileage estimates vary]
**Difficulty range**: Blue (intermediate) through Black (advanced) — rugged, natural terrain
**Confidence**: Single source primarily (Singletracks, MTBR reviews). Limited detail.

#### Trail Character

- Named trails: Atwood West Brow, Estelle Mines, West Brow Cane Section
- Features: whoop-de-doos, gullies, rocks, creek crossings, spectacular views
- Atwood Trail: mostly singletrack with steep climbs and drops
- Primary loop: ~12.4 miles, Moderate/Strenuous rating

**Style/character**: Rugged, natural backcountry riding. Not machine-groomed. Rocks, roots, creek crossings, steep grades. Adventure riding for experienced riders. More "mountain" than "bike trail."

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: UNKNOWN. Creek crossings and natural terrain suggest poor-moderate in wet conditions. [UNVERIFIED]
- **February status**: CRITICAL — WMA access requires Georgia Lands Pass, hunting license, or fishing license. **All horse, bike, caving, hiking, rock climbing trails closed during firearm deer seasons.** Horse and bike trails also closed before 10:00 AM during archery deer and turkey season. **Verify Georgia hunting season dates for February 2026 before planning a ride here.**
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Unknown.

### 13. Black Creek Trail System (near HP40)

**Location**: Noccalula Falls Park, 1600 Noccalula Rd, Gadsden, AL 35904
**Drive from lodging**: ~1.5-2 hrs from ESNP area (similar direction as HP40)
**Drive from HP40**: ~25-30 min (Steele to Gadsden ~13 min, HP40 adds ~10-15 min of mountain road)
**Total rideable trail miles**: ~13 miles (main trail + 7 connecting trails)
**Difficulty range**: Green (beginner/family) through Blue (intermediate)
**Confidence**: Confirmed from multiple sources. Drive time updated from NEABA/Greater Gadsden data.
**CRITICAL**: Noccalula Falls Park is **CLOSED January 1 through February 28**. The main park entrance and campground parking lot (primary trailhead) will be inaccessible during the trip. An alternative lower trailhead exists at Black Creek Road / Tuscaloosa Avenue intersection, but whether MTB singletrack is accessible from this entry during closure is [UNVERIFIED]. **Effectively unusable for this trip without on-the-ground verification.**

#### Trail Breakdown

| Trail | Distance | Character |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| Black Creek Trail (main) | ~1.7 mi each way | Crushed stone path along gorge |
| Family Loop | ~0.6 mi | Easy, family-friendly |
| Jeep Hill Loop | ~1.0 mi | More strenuous |
| Moonshine Ridge | ~0.7 mi | Connecting trail |
| Cascade | ~0.6 mi | Connecting trail |
| Whatley Trail | ~1.0 mi | Moderate technical, rocks |
| Black Creek Bend | ~0.7 mi | Connecting trail |
| Jeep Hill Connector | ~0.3 mi | Short connector |

**Style/character**: Mix of crushed stone path (main trail) and groomed singletrack connecting trails. Moderate technical terrain on some connectors. Along the Black Creek Gorge at the base of Lookout Mountain. Family-friendly core with some more challenging spurs.

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: Mixed. User reports mention muddy spots and slick footing after rain. [Partially UNVERIFIED]
- **February status**: **CLOSED.** Noccalula Falls Park closes Jan 1 – Feb 28. Alternative lower trailhead access [UNVERIFIED].
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Unknown — but southern Alabama location means less freeze risk.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Noccalula Falls Campground parking lot (near Wedding Chapel)
- **Fees**: $6/adult when park is open. Lower trailhead fee status [UNVERIFIED]. Maintained by Northeast Alabama Bicycle Association (NEABA).
- **Hours**: Park hours apply

#### Nearby Climbing Areas (within ~30 min)

- HP40: ~30-40 min [UNVERIFIED — estimated]
- Hospital Boulders: ~30-45 min [UNVERIFIED — estimated]

**Note**: This is the closest identified trail system to HP40. However, it's a modest trail system (~13 mi, mostly beginner/intermediate) and the drive time from HP40 is estimated. If the group is spending a day at HP40, this is the best known biking option nearby, but it's not a destination-caliber ride.

### 14. Oak Mountain State Park (near HP40 — longer drive)

**Location**: 200 Terrace Dr, Pelham, AL 35124 (~20 mi S of Birmingham)
**Drive from lodging**: ~2.5 hrs from ESNP area
**Drive from HP40**: ~1 hr 15 min (Steele to Birmingham ~46 min, Oak Mountain ~20 mi south of Birmingham in Pelham; total ~70 miles)
**Total rideable trail miles**: ~50 miles
**Difficulty range**: Green (beginner) through Black (expert) — IMBA Epic Ride designation
**Confidence**: Confirmed (multiple sources), but distance from HP40 is estimated.

#### Trail Character

- Alabama's largest state park (9,940 acres)
- IMBA Epic Ride designation (one of 52 worldwide)
- Mix of singletrack and some double-track
- ~1,600 ft combined climbing on main loop
- Features: smooth/fast/tight sections, gnarly rooted areas, rock gardens, sand pits, challenging climbs, fast downhills
- Blood Rock: advanced section
- Lake Trail: easy, scenic loop around Double Oak Lake
- "Tails" trail: newer addition off Group Camp Road

**Style/character**: IMBA Epic-rated trail system. A full day of serious riding. Diverse terrain from beginner lake loops to expert rock gardens. This is a destination unto itself, not a "ride while they climb" option.

**HOWEVER**: At ~1-1.5 hours from HP40 and ~2.5 hours from ESNP, this is a major detour. Only viable if the group splits for a full day or on the drive to/from HP40. Included for completeness.

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: Mixed. Most sections "shed water very well" but bottom connector from south trailhead to Jekyll and Hyde gets muddy. Clay soil in places. Check BUMP trail status before driving.
- **February status**: Open year-round (Alabama State Park).
- **Fees**: $5/person (age 12+), $2 (age 4-11), $2 (seniors 62+). Free for under 4, active/retired military, veterans. Annual individual pass: $180.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Park entrance at 200 Terrace Dr, Pelham, AL
- **Hours**: Alabama State Park hours

#### Nearby Climbing Areas (within ~30 min)

- None of the trip's target climbing areas are within 30 min. HP40 is the closest at ~1-1.5 hrs [UNVERIFIED].

### 15. TTC Gravity Park (Sequatchie Valley — near Dunlap)

**Location**: Sequatchie, TN (Sequatchie Valley, between Chattanooga and Dunlap)
**Drive from lodging**: ~45-60 min from ESNP area [UNVERIFIED — estimated]
**Total rideable trail miles**: 7 full DH runs on 650+ acres with 1,000 vertical feet
**Difficulty range**: Intermediate through Expert (downhill/gravity only)
**Confidence**: Single source primarily (TTC website, Trailforks, Pinkbike). Limited current info.

#### Trail Character

- Downhill/gravity-only facility on private property
- 7 full DH runs with shuttle roads to the top
- Trails 1-4 on backside (require 4WD access)
- Trails 5-7 on front (any vehicle)
- Shares land with motorcycle trials facility (shop, bathhouse, cabins)
- Club membership: TTC Downhill MTB (TTCDH), $75/year annual dues

**Style/character**: Dedicated downhill/gravity park. Shuttle-access DH runs. This is NOT cross-country or trail riding — it's pure gravity. For the right rider, this is excellent. Requires a DH or enduro bike.

**IMPORTANT**: Access requires TTCDH membership ($75/year) and riding is subject to motorcycle trials event schedule. Contact TTC before showing up. This is a private facility, not a public trail system.

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: "Open year round, rain or shine" — suggesting rideable in wet conditions. [Single source — treat with caution]
- **February status**: Open year-round per facility claims.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: On-site at TTC facility
- **Fees**: TTCDH membership $75/year; may have day-pass options [UNVERIFIED]
- **Access**: Contact facility first — schedule dependent on motorcycle events

#### Nearby Climbing Areas (within ~30 min)

- Dayton Pocket: ~30-45 min N [UNVERIFIED — estimated]

**Note**: This is a niche option for a dedicated downhill rider. Not suitable for casual trail riding. Included for completeness but likely not relevant for this trip unless the rider specifically wants gravity park DH.

### 16. Coldwater Mountain (near HP40 — best Alabama pairing)

**Location**: 1661 Coldwater Road, Anniston, AL (Coldwater Trailhead); also Anniston Trailhead at 401 Monsanto St
**Drive from lodging**: ~3-3.5 hrs from ESNP area (well outside lodging radius — only viable as HP40 pairing)
**Drive from HP40**: ~50-55 min (Steele to Anniston via I-59 S to I-20 E, Exit 179)
**Total rideable trail miles**: ~50-56 miles of purpose-built singletrack
**Difficulty range**: Green through Black — full IMBA progression
**Confidence**: **HIGH** — confirmed from 12+ sources. IMBA Bronze Level Ride Center. National Recreation Trail designation.

#### Trail Breakdown

| Trail | Distance | Difficulty | Character |
|-------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Mama Bear / Papa Bear / Baby Bear | Beginner loops | Green | Family-friendly intro |
| Bomb Dog | Signature flow trail | Blue | Iconic views, swoopy turns |
| Southern Traverse | ~8.5 mi | Blue | Major expansion trail |
| Gazza | Expert descent | Black | Rocky, technical |
| Gravity trails | ~2 mi dedicated | Black | Purpose-built DH |

**Style/character**: IMBA Trail Solutions-designed flow trails, XC singletrack, gravity descents, technical rock sections. Red-dirt trails with rocky terrain. Switchbacks, pine-needle-covered descents, slick rock features. Full perimeter loop: 3-5 hours depending on skill. Bomb Dog + connector loops: 1.5-2 hours for a solid intermediate session.

#### Conditions

- **Drainage/mud tolerance**: **Excellent.** Rocky terrain means trails shed water very well. Rider reports: "no puddles to speak of" on most trails after multiple days of rain. **Exception**: the connector trail from Bomb Dog to the base is clay and drains poorly. System is rarely officially closed due to weather.
- **February status**: **Open 365 days/year. FREE.** Gate locks ~1 hour after sunset. No seasonal closures. Mild Alabama winters mean little to no snowfall.
- **Freeze/thaw concern**: Minimal — lower latitude and elevation than Chattanooga.

#### Access & Logistics

- **Parking**: Free at Coldwater Trailhead (1661 Coldwater Rd). Take I-20 Exit 179, north 2.1 miles, right onto Coldwater Pump Road, few hundred yards, right onto paved road for 1 mile to parking.
- **Fees**: **FREE** — Forever Wild Land Trust public property. No parking fee, no entry fee.
- **Hours**: Gate locks ~1 hour after sunset.
- **Amenities**: No restrooms or running water at trailhead. Anniston (~10-15 min) has food/water/restrooms.

#### Nearby Climbing Areas (within ~30 min)

- None of the trip's target climbing areas are within 30 min. HP40 is the closest at ~50-55 min.

**Note**: This is the **primary recommended HP40 pairing** — far superior to Black Creek (which is closed in February) and closer than Oak Mountain. The logistical play: biker drives to HP40 with the group, splits off to Coldwater (~55 min), rides a world-class system, then either returns to HP40 or drives directly back toward Chattanooga.

## Trail Systems Investigated but NOT Found / NOT Viable

### White Creek (Dunlap / Sequatchie Valley)

No mountain biking trail system called "White Creek" was found near Dunlap or in the Sequatchie Valley. Multiple searches across Trailforks, MTB Project, Singletracks, and SORBA returned no results. The Sequatchie Valley has road/gravel cycling routes (Cycle Sequatchie) and the TTC Gravity Park, but no XC/trail MTB system by this name.

**Status**: Not found. If this name was a local reference, it may be extremely informal or defunct.

### Colditz Cove (near Dayton)

Colditz Cove State Natural Area (near Allardt, TN, not near Dayton) is a hiking-only destination. The Northrup Falls Trail is 1.3 miles and explicitly for hiking. No mountain biking trails exist here.

**Status**: Not a mountain biking option.

### Lookout Mountain — Covenant College Area (standalone)

Documented above as #8 (Moonshine Trails / CCT). There is no separate, additional trail system beyond what's described. The Guild Trails and NPS trails near Cravens House connect to this system but are limited in scope and some may be hiking-only.

### Trails Near HP40/Steele, Alabama (local area)

No mountain biking trail systems exist on Chandler Mountain or Sand Mountain near HP40. HP40 itself has a 1.7-mile hiking loop but no MTB trails. **Coldwater Mountain in Anniston** (~50-55 min from HP40) was identified as the primary pairing — see Trail #16 above. Henry Farm Park in Jacksonville, AL (~50 min from HP40) has ~3-4 miles of hand-cut singletrack but is too small to be worth the drive.

| **HP40** | **Coldwater Mountain** | **~50-55 min** | **TOP PICK. 50+ mi IMBA-designed. Free. Open 365 days. Excellent drainage.** |
| | Black Creek (Gadsden) | ~25-30 min | **CLOSED IN FEBRUARY** (Noccalula Falls Park closure). Alternative access [UNVERIFIED]. |
| | Oak Mountain State Park | ~1 hr 15 min | IMBA Epic Ride, 50 mi, but too far for parallel day. Standalone only. $5/person. |
| **Dayton Pocket** | ESNP (lodging) | ~50-65 min back to base | No nearby trails; ride at home |
| | TTC Gravity Park | ~30-45 min [UNVERIFIED] | DH-only, membership required |

| | Pigeon Mountain | ~10-20 min | Same WMA access caveats |
| **Hospital Boulders** | Coldwater Mountain | ~1 hr [UNVERIFIED] | Same corridor as HP40; Coldwater is best option |
| | Black Creek (Gadsden) | ~30-45 min | **CLOSED IN FEBRUARY** — see HP40 note |
| **Walden's Ridge** | Walden's Ridge Park | 0 min (same location!) | Perfect pairing — climb and ride same park |
| | Raccoon Mountain | ~15-20 min | Quick drive for more miles |
| | Stringer's Ridge | ~15-20 min | Urban alternative |
