# Quickstart: Using the Rest-Day Guide

## What the Rest-Day Guide Is

The rest-day guide is a "what should we do today?" document for days when the group isn't climbing. It provides pre-vetted options organized by energy level, so you never have to spiral into phone-based research mid-trip.

It is NOT a comprehensive Chattanooga tourism guide. It's a curated list of quality options with enough information to make a quick decision.

## How It Relates to Other Features

- **Climbing area profiles** (Feature 001) = "Where should we climb?"
- **Trail profiles** (Feature 003) = "Where can I ride?"
- **Rest-day guide** (this feature) = "What else can we do?"

The rest-day guide links to climbing and trail profiles — it doesn't duplicate their content.

## Before the Trip

1. **Skim the quick-decision table** in `rest-days/README.md` to know what's available
2. **Star 2-3 food/drink spots** you definitely want to hit during the week
3. **Note which options are rain-proof** — you'll want these ready when weather changes plans

## During the Trip

### "Nobody wants to climb today. What should we do?"

1. Open `rest-days/README.md`
2. Ask the group: "Zero energy, low energy, or active?"
3. Scan that section for options
4. Pick one. Go.

### "It's raining. Now what?"

1. Open `rest-days/README.md`
2. Jump to the "When It Rains" section
3. Pick from rain-proof options
4. No phone research needed

### "We want a short morning session, then chill."

1. Check the "Low-Energy Climbing Sessions" section for nearby half-day spots
2. Or check the "Active-Rest" section for a short hike or easy ride
3. Plan afternoon around zero-energy options (food, brewery, etc.)

### "Someone wants to ride while we rest."

1. Point them to [trails/README.md](../trails/README.md) for riding options
2. The rest of the group picks from zero or low-energy options
3. Regroup for dinner
